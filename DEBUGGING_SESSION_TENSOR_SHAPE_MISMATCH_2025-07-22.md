# Debugging Session: Tensor Shape Mismatch in Probe Generalization Study

**Date:** 2025-07-22  
**Issue:** "Failing 2x2 probe generalization study" - Silent crashes in model comparison pipeline  
**Status:** üîÑ **ANALYSIS DEEPENED** - Gemini revealed fundamental architectural issues beyond initial fix  
**Methodology:** Gemini-assisted systematic analysis with tensor shape debugging  

---

## üìã **Session Overview**

### Initial Problem Statement
The probe generalization study was experiencing silent failures during the model comparison phase. The study aimed to evaluate the performance impact of different probe functions (idealized vs. experimental) across different overlap constraints (gridsize=1 vs. gridsize=2) using a 2x2 experimental matrix.

**Symptoms:**
- 3 out of 4 experimental arms completed successfully
- 1 arm (`ideal_gs2`) crashed silently during comparison phase
- No Python traceback or error messages
- Process termination appeared sudden and unexplained

### What Was Achieved
- **Root Cause Identification:** Tensor shape mismatch between model expectations and input data
- **Systematic Diagnosis:** Used Gemini-assisted analysis to break through debugging tunnel vision
- **Technical Understanding:** Discovered gridsize-dependent model architecture differences
- **Solution Design:** Identified specific fix requirements for dynamic input adaptation
- **Study Completion:** Enabled path to 100% completion (from 75%)

---

## üîç **Debugging Methodology**

### 1. Initial Assessment and Pattern Recognition

**User's Domain Expert Intuition:** 
> "It's clearly a tensor shape inconsistency, probably related to gridsize inconsistency"

**Status:** ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED CORRECT** - This initial hypothesis proved entirely accurate

**Key Insight:** The domain expert immediately suspected the correct root cause, demonstrating the value of subject matter expertise in ML pipeline debugging.

### 2. Systematic Analysis Framework

The debugging approach followed a structured methodology:

#### Phase 1: Context Gathering
- **Study Status Assessment:** Documented completion status of all 4 experimental arms
- **Failure Pattern Analysis:** Identified that only gridsize=2 configurations were failing
- **Environment Verification:** Confirmed 3 arms completed successfully, ruling out broad environmental issues

#### Phase 2: Gemini-Assisted Analysis
- **Tool Used:** `/debug-gemini-v3` command for fresh perspective analysis
- **Purpose:** Break through potential tunnel vision and provide systematic diagnostic approach
- **Context Provided:** Full codebase, git history, and project documentation

#### Phase 3: Targeted Technical Investigation
- **Tensor Shape Logging:** Added diagnostic logging at crash points
- **Model Architecture Comparison:** Compared working vs. failing model configurations
- **Input/Output Validation:** Verified data flow through comparison pipeline

---

## üéØ **Key Findings**

### The Root Cause: Architecture-Dependent Input Requirements

**Technical Issue:**
```python
# The Problem:
ideal_gs1_baseline_model.input_shape = (None, 64, 64, 1)  # ‚Üê 1 channel expected
ideal_gs2_baseline_model.input_shape = (None, 64, 64, 4)  # ‚Üê 4 channels expected

# The Input:
test_container.X.shape = (1000, 64, 64, 1)  # ‚Üê Always 1 channel provided

# The Crash:
baseline_output = baseline_model.predict(test_container.X, batch_size=32, verbose=1)
# ‚Üë Silent TensorFlow C++/CUDA assertion failure when shapes mismatch
```

### Why This Happens: Gridsize-Dependent Architectures

**Discovery:**
- **Gridsize 1 training** ‚Üí Creates baseline models expecting 1-channel input
- **Gridsize 2 training** ‚Üí Creates baseline models expecting 4-channel input  
- **Comparison script assumption** ‚Üí All baseline models have identical input interfaces

**Root Architecture Difference:**
```python
üü¢ Working: gs1 baseline model ‚Üí Input: (None, 64, 64, 1)
üî¥ Failing: gs2 baseline model ‚Üí Input: (None, 64, 64, 4)
```

### Failure Mechanism: Silent C++ Crashes

**Crash Behavior:**
- No Python-level exception or traceback
- Silent termination at TensorFlow C++/CUDA level
- Process exits immediately without cleanup
- Appears as "mysterious" failure to higher-level orchestration

**Debug Evidence:**
```
üîç SHAPE DEBUG: test_container.X shape: (1000, 64, 64, 1)
üîç SHAPE DEBUG: test_container.X dtype: <dtype: 'float32'>
üîç SHAPE DEBUG: baseline_model input shape expected: (None, 64, 64, 4)
üîç SHAPE DEBUG: About to call baseline_model.predict()...
[PROCESS TERMINATED - No Python traceback]
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tools and Techniques Used**

### 1. Gemini-Assisted Analysis (`/debug-gemini-v3`)

**Purpose:** Provide fresh perspective and break through debugging tunnel vision

**Process:**
```bash
# Automated execution of comprehensive analysis
gemini -p "@CLAUDE.md @src/ @ptycho/ @scripts/ @docs/ @configs/ Debug this issue with FRESH EYES..."
```

**Gemini's Key Contributions:**
1. **Exact Crash Prediction:** Correctly predicted crash occurs inside `baseline_model.predict()`
2. **Failure Mechanism:** Identified low-level CUDA/C++ assertion failure pattern
3. **Systematic Approach:** Provided structured diagnostic methodology
4. **Alternative Perspectives:** Challenged assumptions about error location and timing

### 2. Strategic Tensor Shape Logging

**Implementation:**
```python
# Added diagnostic logging in scripts/compare_models.py
logger.info(f"üîç SHAPE DEBUG: test_container.X shape: {test_container.X.shape}")
logger.info(f"üîç SHAPE DEBUG: test_container.X dtype: {test_container.X.dtype}")
logger.info(f"üîç SHAPE DEBUG: baseline_model input shape expected: {baseline_model.input_shape}")
logger.info("üîç SHAPE DEBUG: About to call baseline_model.predict()...")
```

**Key Insight:** Placing logs immediately before crash points reveals exact failure location

### 3. Comparative Model Analysis

**Methodology:**
- Compare successful (`ideal_gs1`) vs. failing (`ideal_gs2`) model architectures
- Document input shape differences systematically
- Verify data pipeline compatibility assumptions

**Results:**
```python
# Successful configuration
Model: ideal_gs1_baseline
Input shape: (None, 64, 64, 1)
Status: ‚úÖ Works with standard 1-channel input

# Failing configuration  
Model: ideal_gs2_baseline
Input shape: (None, 64, 64, 4)
Status: ‚ùå Expects 4-channel input, receives 1-channel
```

## ‚úÖ **Resolution Status**

### Immediate Resolution: Root Cause Identified
- **Diagnosis Complete:** Tensor shape mismatch precisely identified
- **Location Confirmed:** Issue in `scripts/compare_models.py` at line 586
- **Mechanism Understood:** Silent C++ crashes due to TensorFlow shape validation

### Solution Design: Dynamic Input Adaptation

**Required Fix:**
```python
# Current problematic code:
baseline_output = baseline_model.predict(test_container.X, batch_size=32, verbose=1)

# Proposed solution:
expected_channels = baseline_model.input_shape[-1]
if expected_channels != test_container.X.shape[-1]:
    logger.info(f"Adapting input from {test_container.X.shape[-1]} to {expected_channels} channels")
    adapted_input = adapt_input_for_baseline(test_container.X, expected_channels)
    baseline_output = baseline_model.predict(adapted_input, batch_size=32, verbose=1)
else:
    baseline_output = baseline_model.predict(test_container.X, batch_size=32, verbose=1)
```

### Implementation Requirements
1. **Understand Channel Semantics:** Determine what the additional 3 channels represent in gs2 models
2. **Input Transformation Logic:** Implement appropriate conversion from 1-channel to 4-channel format
3. **Validation Testing:** Ensure transformation preserves model performance expectations
4. **Documentation:** Update comparison methodology for gridsize-aware operation

---

## üí° **Lessons Learned**

### 1. Domain Expert Intuition is Invaluable
**Key Insight:** The user's immediate suspicion of "tensor shape inconsistency, probably related to gridsize" was completely accurate.

**Lesson:** 
- Always take domain expert hunches seriously
- Subject matter expertise often identifies root causes faster than systematic analysis
- Combine expert intuition with systematic validation for optimal results

### 2. Gemini Analysis Breaks Tunnel Vision
**What Gemini Provided:**
- Fresh perspective unconstrained by prior assumptions
- Systematic diagnostic methodology
- Accurate prediction of failure mechanisms
- Structured approach to evidence gathering

**Key Value:**
```
Human Expert: "This feels like a tensor shape issue"
Claude (Initial): "Could be timeout, environment, or corruption issues..."
Gemini (Fresh Eyes): "Most likely tensor shape mismatch in model.predict() call"
Resolution: Gemini + Human expert were both right
```

### 3. Silent ML Pipeline Failures Require Proactive Logging
**Challenge:** TensorFlow C++/CUDA assertion failures don't generate Python tracebacks

**Solution Pattern:**
```python
# Always log tensor shapes before critical ML operations
logger.info(f"Input shape: {input_tensor.shape}")
logger.info(f"Model expects: {model.input_shape}")
logger.info("About to call model.predict()...")
model_output = model.predict(input_tensor)
logger.info("model.predict() completed successfully!")
```

### 4. Architecture Assumptions in ML Pipelines
**Anti-Pattern:** Assuming uniform model interfaces across training configurations

**Best Practice:**
- Always validate input/output compatibility between pipeline components
- Different training parameters can create fundamentally different architectures
- Implement dynamic adaptation for robust pipeline operation

### 5. Systematic vs. Intuitive Debugging
**Optimal Approach:** Combine both methodologies
- **Human intuition** ‚Üí Rapid hypothesis generation
- **Systematic analysis** ‚Üí Validation and evidence gathering
- **AI assistance** ‚Üí Fresh perspectives and structured approaches

## üß† **GEMINI'S CRITICAL INSIGHTS** - *Added 2025-07-22 via /debug-gemini-v3*

### üö® **BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERY: Semantic Channel Crisis**

**Gemini's Key Finding:** The initial tensor shape fix was fundamentally flawed - it treats symptoms, not the root cause. The fix creates shape-compatible data that violates the physical meaning required by gridsize=2 models.

#### The Critical Flaw in Our "Fix"

**What our fix does:**
```python
# Our shape adaptation approach
adapted_input = np.repeat(test_container.X, 4, axis=-1)  # Creates 4 identical channels
```

**What gridsize=2 models actually need:**
- **Channel 0**: Diffraction pattern from scan position (x, y)
- **Channel 1**: Diffraction pattern from scan position (x+1, y)  
- **Channel 2**: Diffraction pattern from scan position (x, y+1)
- **Channel 3**: Diffraction pattern from scan position (x+1, y+1)

**Gemini's Analogy:** *"It's like telling a color image processor to work on a grayscale image by copying the gray channel to the R, G, and B channels‚Äîit runs, but the results are not meaningful."*

### üìä **Alternative Root Causes (Ranked by Probability)**

#### 1. **Incorrect Semantic Meaning of Channels (VERY HIGH)**
- **Issue**: Our fix feeds identical data to all 4 channels
- **Reality**: gridsize=2 models expect 4 semantically distinct neighboring patches
- **Impact**: Model receives physically meaningless data that satisfies shape but not physics

#### 2. **Biased Subsampling Breaking Overlap Constraints (HIGH)** 
- **Issue**: DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md Section 8 warns about subsampling before neighbor-grouping
- **Reality**: `compare_models.py` likely selects spatially contiguous block, breaking overlap relationships
- **Impact**: gridsize=2 models trained/tested on physically incoherent data

#### 3. **Silent Data Corruption in Pipeline (MEDIUM)**
- **Issue**: Historical bugs in `ptycho/raw_data.py` with implicit dtype changes
- **Reality**: Channel data may be malformed before reaching predict() call
- **Impact**: Silent corruption similar to past complex‚Üíreal conversion bugs

### üî¨ **Gemini's Diagnostic Plan**

#### Immediate Actions Required:

**1. Verify Channel Semantics (CRITICAL)**
```python
# Add to compare_models.py after test_container creation
if test_container.X.shape[-1] == 4:
    logger.info("Saving channel data for inspection...")
    for i in range(4):
        plt.imsave(f"{args.output_dir}/debug_channel_{i}.png", 
                  test_container.X[0, :, :, i], cmap='gray')
```
**Expected**: 4 different but related neighboring patch images  
**Failure mode**: 4 identical images confirms data loading pipeline failure

**2. Architectural Redesign Required**
- `compare_models.py` must become "gridsize-aware"  
- Create separate data containers for each model using native gridsize
- Remove shape adaptation hack entirely

**3. Data Loading Logic Verification**
- Verify "smart group-then-sample" logic works in `ptycho/raw_data.py`
- Check if `generate_grouped_data` function properly handles multi-channel creation

### üéØ **Systemic Architecture Issues Identified**

#### The Fundamental Design Flaw
**Current Assumption**: All models can use the same test data with shape adaptation  
**Reality**: Different gridsize models require fundamentally different data preparation

#### Required Pipeline Redesign
```python
# Current (BROKEN) approach:
test_container = create_single_container(test_data, gridsize=inferred_from_somewhere)
pinn_output = pinn_model.predict(adapt_shape_for_pinn(test_container.X))
baseline_output = baseline_model.predict(adapt_shape_for_baseline(test_container.X))

# Gemini's recommended (CORRECT) approach:
pinn_container = create_container_for_gridsize(test_data, pinn_gridsize)
baseline_container = create_container_for_gridsize(test_data, baseline_gridsize)
pinn_output = pinn_model.predict(pinn_container.X)  # No adaptation needed
baseline_output = baseline_model.predict(baseline_container.X)  # No adaptation needed
```

### üß™ **Minimal Reproduction Strategy**

**Goal**: Verify gs=2 model works with semantically correct data

**Step 1**: Manually create valid 4-channel input:
```python
# Extract 4 neighboring diffraction patterns: p1, p2, p3, p4
manual_input = np.stack([p1, p2, p3, p4], axis=-1)[np.newaxis, ...]  # Shape: (1, 64, 64, 4)
```

**Step 2**: Test direct model prediction:
```python
baseline_output = gs2_baseline_model.predict(manual_input)
# Should produce coherent reconstruction without crashes
```

**Expected Result**: Model works correctly with proper multi-channel data

### üîç **Fix Validation Requirements**

#### The "Identity Test"
Train a gs=2 model using repeated-channel data (our current fix). Performance should match gs=1 model if the fix is valid. **Prediction**: Performance will be significantly worse, proving our approach is flawed.

#### The "Single Channel Test"  
Compare results using each of the 4 channels individually in gs2‚Üígs1 conversion. If results differ wildly, it proves channels contain unique information being discarded.

### üí° **Key Lessons from Gemini Analysis**

1. **Shape ‚â† Semantics**: Matching tensor shapes doesn't preserve physical meaning
2. **Pipeline Assumptions**: `compare_models.py` embeds gs=1 assumptions throughout  
3. **Data Contracts**: Multi-channel data has semantic contracts beyond shape requirements
4. **Architectural Incompatibility**: gs=1 and gs=2 models may be fundamentally incomparable without proper data preparation

### üöÄ **Recommended Next Steps**

1. **VALIDATE CURRENT FIX**: Run channel inspection code to confirm our fix creates meaningless data
2. **IMPLEMENT GRIDSIZE-AWARE COMPARISON**: Redesign `compare_models.py` for proper multi-gridsize support  
3. **VERIFY DATA PIPELINE**: Ensure `generate_grouped_data` creates valid multi-channel data
4. **SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION**: Compare reconstruction quality with proper vs. adapted data

**Gemini's Bottom Line**: *"Your leading theory is correct but incomplete. The comparison pipeline is currently breaking the semantic contract by treating all test data as single-channel and attempting to patch the shape mismatch without preserving the physical meaning."*
