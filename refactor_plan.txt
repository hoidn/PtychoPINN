Summary of Actions Taken:

1. Attempted to refactor the `PtychoDataset` class to use a nested structure for the data attributes.
   - The class was to be modified to store training and testing data within a nested dictionary structure with 'train' and 'test' keys.
   - Each of these keys would map to another dictionary containing 'X', 'coords', 'probe', and 'Y'.

2. Encountered issues with the *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format, which led to unsuccessful attempts to apply the changes through the chat.

3. The necessary refactoring was ultimately performed manually by the user.

Note: The above actions were intended to improve the organization of the dataset attributes within the `PtychoDataset` class and to make the codebase more maintainable and readable.
