running the 2x2 study reveals an issue with the synthetic data generation -> training pipeline with gridsize = 2. previously gridsize 2 worked with experimental and synthetic data, so this could be a regression or an issue that for some reason shows up in this workflow but not other synthetic data based workflows, such as /run_complete_generalization_study.sh. i suspected coordinate issues but it doesn't seem that swapping x y or inverting either or both coord helps. visual debugging might be useful. it'll be important to approach this systematically
