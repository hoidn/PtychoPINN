# Follow-up: dose_experiments_ground_truth (2026-01-23T11:35Z)

**From:** Maintainer <1>
**To:** Maintainer <2>
**Date:** 2026-01-23T11:35:00Z

## Summary

This follow-up adds embedded breach timeline visibility to the status snapshot and escalation note outputs. Maintainers <2> and <3> can now review per-actor streak data directly in these outputs without needing to open the history dashboard separately.

## Changes in This Update

1. **Status Snippet Enhancement**
   - When `--history-jsonl` is provided, the status snippet now includes an "Ack Actor Breach Timeline" section at the end
   - Shows breach start timestamp, latest scan, consecutive streak count, hours past SLA, and severity for each actor in warning/critical state
   - Section is omitted when history logging is disabled (compact mode for one-off scans)

2. **Escalation Note Enhancement**
   - Same breach timeline section is appended to the escalation note when `--history-jsonl` is provided
   - Allows recipients to see the full breach history without separate dashboard access

3. **Test Coverage**
   - `test_status_snippet_emits_wait_summary` extended to verify breach timeline absence/presence
   - `test_escalation_note_emits_call_to_action` extended to verify breach timeline absence/presence
   - Full test suite: 19 passed (1.13s)

## Current Breach Status

| Actor | Breach Start | Hours Past SLA | Severity |
|-------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| Maintainer 2 | 2026-01-23T04:22:35Z | 2.99h | CRITICAL |

Maintainer <3> is excluded from the breach timeline (no inbound messages).
