## feat: Complete unified sampling update and pty-chi integration improvements

### Summary
This commit finalizes the unified sampling strategy for all gridsize values and improves the pty-chi integration in the comparison framework. The changes eliminate special-casing for gridsize=1 and ensure consistent, reproducible sampling behavior across all configurations.

### Key Changes

#### 1. Unified Sampling Strategy
- **Removed gridsize=1 special case** in `workflows/components.py`: All gridsize values now use the same "sample-then-group" strategy
- **Consistent random sampling**: The data pipeline now handles random sampling internally for all gridsize values
- **Sequential sampling option**: Added `--sequential_sampling` flag for users who need the old sequential behavior
- **Backwards compatible**: Pre-shuffled datasets continue to work correctly

#### 2. Documentation Updates
- **Updated DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md**: Revised Section 8 to reflect unified sampling approach
- **Updated FLY64_DATASET_GUIDE.md**: Clarified that manual shuffling is no longer required for gridsize=1
- **Added pty-chi migration reference** in CLAUDE.md for better discoverability
- **Updated shuffle_dataset_tool.py**: Added note about tool's continued utility for benchmark datasets

#### 3. Bug Fixes
- **Fixed XLA condition check** in `tf_helper.py`: Corrected logic to properly use ImageProjectiveTransformV3 when XLA is disabled
- **Fixed bash syntax error** in `run_complete_generalization_study.sh`: Added missing `fi` statement for 2-way comparison test size handling
- **Fixed None offset handling** in `image/stitching.py`: Prevent TypeError when offset is None for gridsize=1

#### 4. Pty-chi Integration Enhancements
- **Improved algorithm detection** in `compare_models.py`: Now properly detects and labels pty-chi vs Tike reconstructions
- **Algorithm-specific labeling**: Displays "Pty-chi (ePIE)" or similar variant names in comparison outputs
- **Metadata extraction**: Enhanced to extract algorithm variant information from reconstruction NPZ files

### Impact
- **Simplified codebase**: Removed complex conditional logic for different gridsize values
- **Improved reproducibility**: Consistent sampling behavior across all configurations
- **Better user experience**: No need to manually shuffle datasets for gridsize=1
- **Enhanced pty-chi support**: Clearer labeling and proper algorithm detection in comparisons

### Testing
- Integration tests pass with the unified sampling approach
- Backwards compatibility verified with existing shuffled datasets
- Pty-chi reconstructions properly detected and labeled in comparison outputs

### Breaking Changes
None - all existing workflows and datasets remain compatible.

### Migration Notes
- Users can stop manually shuffling datasets for gridsize=1 training
- Use `--sequential_sampling` flag if you need the old sequential behavior
- Existing shuffled datasets will continue to work without modification
