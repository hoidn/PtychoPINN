## Summary
Activate probe parameterization initiative by moving from archive to active directory

Move probe parameterization initiative from `plans/archive/` to `plans/active/` directory and update PROJECT_STATUS.md to reflect the new active status. This initiative focuses on refactoring probe parameterization study tools for reusability and modularity.

## Changes Made

### File Operations
- **Moved**: `plans/archive/2025-08-probe-parameterization/` â†’ `plans/active/2025-08-probe-parameterization/`
  - Includes all planning documents: `plan.md`, `implementation.md`, phase checklists

### Documentation Updates
- **Modified**: `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`
  - Updated Current Active Initiative path from archive to active
  - Updated all doc-ref paths to point to new active location
  - R&D Plan, Implementation Plan, and Current Checklist references updated

## Initiative Status
- **Name**: Probe Parameterization Study - Refactoring Phase
- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Refactor for Reusability and Modularity  
- **Progress**: 0% (Planning complete, implementation ready to begin)
- **Next Milestone**: Create robust, reusable tools with proper process isolation

## Context
This initiative was previously archived after completion of the successful probe study. Now reactivated to focus on cleaning up and refactoring the experimental scripts into robust, reusable tools following the two-stage (prepare/execute) architecture that proved successful.
