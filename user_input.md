Focus on the Phase D checklist item D0 (Planning — implementation-agnostic parity logging + maintainer coordination) in plans/active/DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001/implementation.md. Produce a clear, versioned parity-logging spec (including probe logging) and concrete maintainer coordination steps, with dataset parity guidance (same input .npz or checksum/provenance handoff) and a two-track comparison plan if exact dataset parity is not possible.
