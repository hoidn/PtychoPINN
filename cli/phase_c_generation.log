WARNING:tensorflow:From /home/ollie/miniconda3/envs/ptycho311/lib/python3.11/site-packages/tensorflow_probability/python/distributions/distribution.py:342: calling _Independent.__init__ (from tensorflow_probability.python.distributions.independent) with reinterpreted_batch_ndims=None is deprecated and will be removed after 2022-03-01.
Instructions for updating:
Please pass an integer value for `reinterpreted_batch_ndims`. The current behavior corresponds to `reinterpreted_batch_ndims=tf.size(distribution.batch_shape_tensor()) - 1`.
