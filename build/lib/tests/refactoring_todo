Use PtychoData class
get rid of nominal vs actual coordinates
move 'lines' simulation into its own file
split tf_helper into multiple files
move some of the stuff in loader into tf_helper
functional interface (probe should be an explicit
	parameter instead of part of the configuration).
don't divide by intensity scale, since we then have to multiply it back
in
clarify the role of c_outer and all that and clean up model.py
