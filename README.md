# Physics Constrained Unsupervised Deep Learning for Rapid, High Resolution Scanning Coherent Diffraction Reconstruction

This repository contains the codebase for the methods presented in the paper "[Physics Constrained Unsupervised Deep Learning for Rapid, High Resolution Scanning Coherent Diffraction Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11014.pdf)". 

## Overview
PtychoPINN is an unsupervised physics-informed neural network reconstruction method designed to facilitate real-time imaging by bypassing the resolution limitations of optics. PtychoPINN uses a NN autoencoder framework for fast reconstruction and improves imaging quality by combining the diffraction forward map with real-space overlap constraints.

## Features
- **Unsupervised / self-supervised learning**: There is no need for extensive labeled training data, making the model more practical to train.
- **Resolution**: PtychoPINN outperforms existing deep learning models for ptychographic reconstruction in terms of image quality, with a 10 dB PSNR increase and a 3- to 6-fold gain in linear resolution. Generalizability and robustness are also improved.
- **Scalability and Speed**: PtychoPINN is two or three orders of magnitude as fast as iterative scanning CDI reconstruction.

## Usage
`python setup.py install`
