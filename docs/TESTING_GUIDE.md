## Running Tests

From the repository root:

- `pytest tests/test_generate_data.py`
- `pytest tests/test_generic_loader.py`

## Test Areas

- `tests/workflows/`: end-to-end workflow checks.
- `tests/io/`, `tests/image/`: IO and image utilities.
- `tests/torch/`: Torch-related tests (if present).

## Notes

- Some modules include legacy tests under `ptycho/tests/`.
