"""
probe_trainable: bool = False
    Optimizes the probe function during training. Experimental feature.

intensity_scale_trainable: bool = True
    Optimize the model's internal amplitude scaling factor during training. Typically 
    left True.

object_big: bool = True
    Enables a separate real-space reconstruction for each input
    diffraction image before the averaging / overlap constraint step. If
    False, no explicit averaging is performed and the decoders return a
    single real space image instead of `gridsize**2` images. Typically
    left True.

probe_mask: bool = False
    Whether to apply circular mask to the probe function. Enable to suppress
    rectangular edge artifacts. Should be used with probe_big = False.

pad_object: bool = True
    Whether to reconstruct the full real space grid (True) or restrict
    to N/2 x N/2 (False). True strictly enforces the necessary
    reciprocal space oversampling, but may cause truncation issues for
    probe amplitudes with long tails (this can be mitigated by setting
    probe_big). Typically left True.

probe_big: bool = True
    if True, enables a low-resolution reconstruction of the outer
    region of the NxN real-space grid. This technically violates the
    zero-padding / oversampling condition, but may be needed if the
    probe illumination has wide tails. Has no effect unless pad_object
    is True.

probe_scale: float = 4.0
    Scaling factor for the probe amplitude. 

gaussian_smoothing_sigma: float = 0.0
    Standard deviation for Gaussian smoothing of probe illumination. Increase from 0 
    to reduce noise / artifacts at cost of resolution.
