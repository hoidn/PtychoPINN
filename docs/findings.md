# PtychoPINN Knowledge Base (NanoBragg Standard)

This ledger captures the most important lessons, conventions, and recurring issues discovered across the project. Before starting new work—or especially when debugging—consult this table to avoid repeating known mistakes.

| Finding ID | Date | Keywords | Synopsis | Evidence Pointer | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| CONVENTION-001 | 2025-10-16 | architecture, legacy, global-state | The codebase consists of a legacy grid-based system tied to `params.cfg` and a modern coordinate-based system; pick the right side before changing anything. | [Link](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#1-the-core-concept-a-two-system-architecture) | Active |
| POLICY-001 | 2025-10-17 | policy, PyTorch, dependencies, mandatory | PyTorch (torch>=2.2) is now a mandatory dependency for PtychoPINN as of Phase F (INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001). All code in `ptycho_torch/` and `tests/torch/` assumes PyTorch is installed. Torch-optional execution paths were removed; modules raise actionable RuntimeError if torch import fails. Tests in `tests/torch/` are automatically skipped in TensorFlow-only CI environments via directory-based pytest collection rules in `tests/conftest.py`, but will fail with actionable ImportError messages if PyTorch is missing in local development. Migration rationale and implementation evidence documented in governance decision and Phase F implementation logs. | [Link](plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T184624Z/governance_decision.md) | Active |
| ANTIPATTERN-001 | 2025-10-16 | imports, side-effects, debugging | Import-time side effects (e.g., loading data in module scope) caused hidden crashes; always push work into functions with explicit arguments. | [Link](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#21-anti-pattern-side-effects-on-import) | Active |
| CONFIG-001 | 2025-10-16 | params.cfg, initialization-order | `update_legacy_dict(params.cfg, config)` must run before any legacy module executes; missing this broke gridsize sync and legacy interop. | [Link](docs/debugging/QUICK_REFERENCE_PARAMS.md#⚠️-the-golden-rule) | Active |
| CONFIG-002 | 2025-10-20 | execution-config, cli, params.cfg | PyTorch execution configuration (PyTorchExecutionConfig) controls runtime behavior only and MUST NOT populate params.cfg. Only canonical configs (TrainingConfig, InferenceConfig) bridge via CONFIG-001. CLI helpers auto-detect accelerator default='auto' and validate execution config fields via factory integration. Execution config applied at priority level 2 (between explicit overrides and dataclass defaults). | [Link](plans/active/ADR-003-BACKEND-API/reports/2025-10-20T150020Z/phase_e_governance_spec_redline/spec_redline.md) | Active |
| CONFIG-LOGGER-001 | 2025-10-24 | logger, execution-config, lightning, mlflow | PyTorch training uses CSVLogger by default (`PyTorchExecutionConfig.logger_backend='csv'`) to capture train/validation metrics from Lightning `self.log()` calls, replacing prior `logger=False` which discarded metrics. Allowed backends: `csv` (zero deps, CI-friendly), `tensorboard` (requires tensorboard from TF install), `mlflow` (requires mlflow package + server), `none` (disable). Legacy `--disable_mlflow` flag deprecated with DeprecationWarning mapping to `--logger none`. MLflow migration to Lightning MLFlowLogger tracked as Phase EB3.C4 backlog. Decision rationale and implementation evidence in governance decision approval record. | [Link](plans/active/ADR-003-BACKEND-API/reports/2025-10-20T153300Z/phase_e_execution_knobs/2025-10-23T110500Z/decision/approved.md) | Active |
| BUG-TF-001 | 2025-10-16 | shape-mismatch, gridsize, tests | Gridsize > 1 yields channel mismatches unless `params.cfg['gridsize']` is populated before `generate_grouped_data`; verify config vs params values. | [Link](docs/debugging/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#shape-mismatch-errors) | Active |
| DATA-001 | 2025-10-16 | data-contract, npz, io | All NPZ datasets must follow the canonical specification (keys, dtypes, normalization); deviations caused silent inference failures. | [Link](specs/data_contracts.md) | Active |
| NORMALIZATION-001 | 2025-10-16 | scaling, physics, preprocessing | Three independent normalization systems (physics, statistical, display) must never be mixed; applying scaling in the wrong stage created double-scaling bugs. | [Link](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#35-normalization-architecture-three-distinct-systems) | Active |
| STUDY-001 | 2025-10-16 | fly64, baseline, generalization | On fly64 experiments the baseline model outperformed PtychoPINN by ~6–10 dB, contradicting expectations and motivating architecture review. | [Link](docs/FLY64_GENERALIZATION_STUDY_ANALYSIS.md#key-findings) | Active |
| OVERSAMPLING-001 | 2025-10-16 | oversampling, gridsize, combinatorics | Oversampling only works when `gridsize > 1` and `K > C`; otherwise requested groups can never exceed raw images. | [Link](docs/debugging/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#oversampling-not-working) | Active |
| MIGRATION-001 | 2025-10-16 | params-removal, refactor, strategy | 66+ files still depend on `params.cfg`; migration plan is to eliminate new uses, document remaining ones, then remove the dependency. | [Link](docs/debugging/QUICK_REFERENCE_PARAMS.md#the-66-file-problem) | Active |
| PROCEDURE-001 | 2025-10-16 | review, defensive-coding | Flag hidden `params` reads and undocumented dependencies during code review; insist on explicit parameters or documented prerequisites. | [Link](docs/debugging/QUICK_REFERENCE_PARAMS.md#red-flags-in-code-review-🚩) | Active |
| FORMAT-001 | 2025-10-17 | data-contract, npz, legacy-format, transpose | Some NPZ datasets use legacy (H,W,N) diffraction array format instead of DATA-001 compliant (N,H,W); caused IndexError in PyTorch dataloader when nn_indices referenced global positions beyond first dimension. Auto-transpose heuristic added to both `_get_diffraction_stack()` and `npz_headers()` to detect and fix at runtime. | [Link](plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T230724Z/callchain/summary.md) | Active |
