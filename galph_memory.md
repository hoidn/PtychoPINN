# 2026-01-28T05:00:00Z: FNO-STABILITY-OVERHAUL-001 — Phase 1 verified, Phase 2 handoff

- dwell: 0 (still ready_for_implementation; handed new production work to engineer)
- Focus issue: FNO-STABILITY-OVERHAUL-001 — Phase 2 (StablePtychoBlock + stable_hybrid registry/CLI)
- Action type: Review/Planning (verified engineer progress, updated plan + Do Now)
- Mode: Implementation guidance
- Git sync: skipped (dirty working tree noted earlier; no pulls)
- Documents reviewed: docs/index.md, docs/fix_plan.md, docs/findings.md (FORWARD-SIG-001 / OUTPUT-COMPLEX-001), docs/strategy/mainstrategy.md, docs/workflows/pytorch.md, plans/active/FNO-STABILITY-OVERHAUL-001/{implementation.md,summary.md}, plans/active/FNO-STABILITY-OVERHAUL-001/reports/2026-01-28T020500Z/{summary.md,*.log}, tests/torch/test_fno_generators.py, scripts/studies/grid_lines_{torch_runner.py,compare_wrapper.py}

**Phase 1 verification:**
- Confirmed `gradient_clip_algorithm` now lives on TF TrainingConfig, config_bridge, and params.cfg; `tests/torch/test_config_bridge.py::TestConfigBridgeParity::test_training_config_gradient_clip_algorithm_roundtrip` collected/passed (log archived under `plans/active/FNO-STABILITY-OVERHAUL-001/reports/2026-01-28T020500Z/test_config_bridge_grad_clip.log`).
- Verified compare wrapper flag + runner propagation via `pytest tests/test_grid_lines_compare_wrapper.py::test_wrapper_passes_grad_clip_algorithm -v` and `pytest tests/torch/test_grid_lines_torch_runner.py -k gradient_clip_algorithm -v` (logs archived beside above).
- Updated plan Task 1.1 + 1.4 statuses to COMPLETE, expanded Phase 2 tasks with explicit steps/tests per writing-plans skill.

**Phase 2 handoff:**
- Do Now: Implement StablePtychoBlock + StableHybrid generator + CLI wiring (plans/active/FNO-STABILITY-OVERHAUL-001/implementation.md Tasks 2.1–2.3).
- Input.md next loop should map selectors: `pytest tests/torch/test_fno_generators.py -k stable -v`, `pytest tests/test_grid_lines_compare_wrapper.py::test_wrapper_handles_stable_hybrid -v`, `pytest tests/torch/test_grid_lines_torch_runner.py::TestChannelGridsizeAlignment::test_runner_accepts_stable_hybrid -v` (or similar).
- Artifacts path reserved: `plans/active/FNO-STABILITY-OVERHAUL-001/reports/2026-01-28T050000Z/`.

# 2026-01-28T00:00:00Z: GRID-LINES-WORKFLOW-001 — Review + implementation handoff (test fixture fix)

- dwell: 0 (new focus; switched from PARALLEL-API-INFERENCE)
- Focus issue: GRID-LINES-WORKFLOW-001 — Grid-based lines simulation + training workflow
- Action type: Review → Implementation handoff
- Mode: Implementation
- Git sync: `git pull --rebase` → failed (unstaged changes: sync/state.json, train_debug.log). Skipped.
- Documents reviewed: docs/fix_plan.md, galph_memory.md, plans/active/GRID-LINES-WORKFLOW-001/plan.md, plans/active/GRID-LINES-WORKFLOW-001/summary.md, plans/active/GRID-LINES-WORKFLOW-001/test_strategy.md, docs/plans/2026-01-27-grid-lines-workflow.md, ptycho/workflows/grid_lines_workflow.py, scripts/studies/grid_lines_workflow.py, tests/test_grid_lines_workflow.py, tests/torch/test_grid_lines_torch_runner.py, docs/findings.md (CONFIG-001, STITCH-GRIDSIZE-001).

**Initiative Status Assessment:**
- All plan tasks (0-7) implemented; workflow module, CLI, torch runner, compare wrapper all complete
- TF workflow tests: 15/15 PASSED (4.13s)
- Torch runner tests: 21/23 passed, **2 FAILED**
  - `test_runner_creates_run_directory_structure`: ValueError from missing metadata in fixture
  - `test_runner_returns_predictions_complex`: Same root cause
- Root cause: `synthetic_npz` fixture uses `np.savez()` instead of `MetadataManager.save_with_metadata()`, so `_stitch_for_metrics` → `_configure_stitching_params` raises ValueError
- No stubs, TODOs, or NotImplementedError remaining in production code

**Delegation:**
- Fix: Update `synthetic_npz` fixture to save with metadata (matching pattern in passing test at line 296)
- Validate: 23/23 torch runner tests + 15/15 TF workflow tests

**input.md Updated:** Test fixture fix with root cause analysis and verification commands.

- Next: Ralph fixes fixture, runs full regression

# 2026-01-09T02:00:00Z: PARALLEL-API-INFERENCE — Task 1 implementation handoff

- dwell: 1 (continuing focus from prior planning loop)
- Focus issue: PARALLEL-API-INFERENCE — Programmatic TF/PyTorch API parity (Task 1)
- Action type: Implementation handoff (TF helper extraction)
- Mode: Implementation
- Git sync: `git pull --rebase` → Already up to date.

**Phase A Review:**
- Extraction design complete: `reports/2026-01-09T010000Z/extraction_design.md`
- Proposed signature mirrors PyTorch helper: `_run_tf_inference_and_reconstruct(model, raw_data, config, ...) -> (amp, phase)`
- Ground truth handling moved to separate `extract_ground_truth()` utility
- `perform_inference` becomes deprecated wrapper for backward compatibility

**Task 1 Implementation Scope:**
1. Create `_run_tf_inference_and_reconstruct()` in `scripts/inference/inference.py`
2. Create `extract_ground_truth()` utility
3. Refactor `perform_inference` as deprecated wrapper calling new helper
4. Create `tests/scripts/test_tf_inference_helper.py` with signature validation tests
5. Run integration regression to verify no breakage

**Mapped Tests:**
- `tests/scripts/test_tf_inference_helper.py::TestTFInferenceHelper` (new, 4 tests)
- `tests/test_integration_workflow.py` (regression)

# 2026-01-08T21:00:00Z: STUDY-SYNTH-FLY64-DOSE-OVERLAP-001 — G-scaled verification review + next phase

- dwell: 1 (continuing focus; Ralph committed G-scaled test in db8f15bd + evidence in 995fcc68)
- Focus issue: STUDY-SYNTH-FLY64-DOSE-OVERLAP-001 — G-scaled: Verify lazy loading enables chunked PINN inference
- Action type: Review → Implementation handoff (phase progression)
- Mode: Implementation
- Git sync: `git pull --rebase` → Already up to date.
- Documents reviewed: docs/fix_plan.md, galph_memory.md (prior entry), docs/findings.md (PINN-CHUNKED-001 RESOLVED), pytest_lazy_loading.log (14 tests, 13 passed), pytest_model_factory.log (3/3 passed), plans/active/STUDY-SYNTH-FLY64-DOSE-OVERLAP-001/summary.md.

**Ralph's Work Verified:**
- Commit db8f15bd: Added `test_container_numpy_slicing_for_chunked_inference`
- Commit 995fcc68: Archived pytest evidence
- Tests: 14 collected, 13 passed, 1 OOM skipped
- Model factory regression: 3/3 PASSED (25.87s)
- PINN-CHUNKED-001: Marked RESOLVED in docs/findings.md

**G-scaled Test Outcome:**
- `_X_np`, `_coords_nominal_np` attributes exist on container ✅
- NumPy slicing works without populating tensor cache ✅
- Backward-compatible `.X` access still works ✅

**Next Phase: G-scaled Integration Test**
The unit test proves the API supports chunked access. Now need to verify compare_models.py can actually use this API without OOM. This requires a minimal integration test with real compare_models invocation.

**Blocker Assessment:**
- PINN-CHUNKED-001: ✅ RESOLVED (lazy container enables NumPy slicing)
- BASELINE-CHUNKED-001/002: Still active (Baseline inference OOM) — separate issue from PINN chunking
- G-full: Still blocked on resource/architecture limits
- G-scaled: Ready for integration test

**input.md Updated:** Integration test to run compare_models with chunked PINN using lazy container.

# 2026-01-08T20:30:00Z: STUDY-SYNTH-FLY64-DOSE-OVERLAP-001 — G-scaled verification handoff

- dwell: 0 (new focus after FEAT-LAZY-LOADING-001 completion)
- Focus issue: STUDY-SYNTH-FLY64-DOSE-OVERLAP-001 — G-scaled: Verify lazy loading enables chunked PINN inference
- Action type: Implementation handoff (chunking verification test)
- Mode: Implementation
- Git sync: `git pull --rebase` → Already up to date.
- Documents reviewed: docs/fix_plan.md, galph_memory.md, docs/findings.md (PINN-CHUNKED-001 resolved), ptycho/loader.py (lazy container), plans/active/STUDY-SYNTH-FLY64-DOSE-OVERLAP-001/summary.md (prior state).

**Prior Blocker Analysis:**
- PINN-CHUNKED-001: ✅ RESOLVED via FEAT-LAZY-LOADING-001
- BASELINE-CHUNKED-001/002: Still active (Baseline OOM issues)
- Root cause was `PtychoDataContainer.__init__` → `tf.convert_to_tensor()` for all data

**Lazy Loading Enables:**
- `._X_np`, `._Y_I_np`, etc. — direct NumPy array access
- Chunk-wise slicing without GPU allocation
- `as_tf_dataset(batch_size)` for streaming training

**G-scaled Task:**
Add test `test_container_numpy_slicing_for_chunked_inference` to verify:
1. Container exposes `_X_np`, `_coords_nominal_np` for chunking
2. Chunk slicing works without triggering full tensor conversion
3. Backward compatibility (full `.X` access still works)

**input.md Updated:** G1-G3 tasks for chunking verification test.

- Next: Ralph adds chunking test, runs all lazy loading tests, archives evidence

# 2026-01-08T20:00:00Z: FEAT-LAZY-LOADING-001 — INITIATIVE COMPLETE, focus selection

- dwell: 0 (initiative complete; no further loops needed)
- Focus issue: FEAT-LAZY-LOADING-001 — ✅ COMPLETE
- Action type: Review/Housekeeping (verification of Phase C completion + focus selection)
- Mode: Review
- Git sync: `git pull --rebase` → Already up to date.
- Documents reviewed: docs/fix_plan.md, galph_memory.md (prior entry), plans/active/FEAT-LAZY-LOADING-001/reports/2026-01-08T030000Z/pytest_phase_c.log, pytest --collect-only output (13 tests in test_lazy_loading.py).

**Phase C Verification (COMPLETE):**
- Tests PASSED: 12/13 (1 OOM skip)
  - TestEagerLoadingOOM: 3 memory scaling + 1 OOM skip
  - TestLazyLoading: 5 tests (avoids_oom, backward_compat, caching, tensor_input, len_method)
  - TestStreamingTraining: 4 tests (dataset_structure, auto_detection, use_streaming_param, batch_count)
- Regression: `test_model_factory.py` 3/3 PASSED (25.61s)
- Commit bd8d9480: FEAT-LAZY-LOADING-001 Phase C complete

**Initiative Summary:**
FEAT-LAZY-LOADING-001 is DONE. All phases complete:
- Phase A: OOM reproduction tests
- Phase B: Lazy container (`PtychoDataContainer` with `_X_np` storage, lazy properties, `as_tf_dataset()`)
- Phase C: Training integration (`train()` with `use_streaming` parameter, auto-detection)

**PINN-CHUNKED-001 Finding:** Marked RESOLVED in `docs/findings.md`. Large datasets can now use `as_tf_dataset()` or direct NumPy slicing.

**Focus Selection:**
- FEAT-LAZY-LOADING-001: done ✅
- STUDY-SYNTH-FLY64-DOSE-OVERLAP-001: ~~blocked_escalation~~ → pending (PINN-CHUNKED-001 resolved)
- FIX-TF-C1D-SCALED-RERUN-001: ~~in_progress~~ → blocked (stale since 2025-11-20)
- FIX-PYTORCH-FORWARD-PARITY-001: blocked on FIX-TF-C1D-SCALED-RERUN-001
- PARALLEL-API-INFERENCE: planning

**Decision:** STUDY-SYNTH-FLY64-DOSE-OVERLAP-001 was blocked primarily on PINN-CHUNKED-001 (OOM). With lazy loading complete, the G-scaled goal is now feasible. Marked FIX-TF-C1D-SCALED-RERUN-001 as blocked (stale).
