# Galph Supervisor Memory

## 2025-10-16T230319Z: Initial entry
- No prior galph_memory.md existed; starting fresh after syncing with origin (repo already up to date).
- Required docs `specs/spec-a.md`, `arch.md`, `docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md`, and `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` are missing; note for future reconciliation with instructions.
- Coin flip (heads) triggered audit of last ~10 commits: recent work is primarily documentation and workflow setup; no evidence of the high-priority pytest triage or vectorization tasks being executed yet.
- Action type: Planning.
- Mode: none.
- Observations: docs/fix_plan.md still centers on PyTorch integration tasks and lacks items for current urgent goals.



## 2025-10-17T011918Z: Loop Planning Setup
- Focus issue: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 (PyTorch ↔ Ptychodus integration)
- Action type: Planning
- Mode: Docs
- Notes: Recorded selections prior to plan drafting.
- Reference docs for this loop:
  - specs/ptychodus_api_spec.md — authoritative reconstructor contract spanning config/data/persistence requirements.
  - plans/ptychodus_pytorch_integration_plan.md — prior parity map to salvage; needs restructuring.
  - docs/workflows/pytorch.md — current PyTorch workflow and parity guardrails.
  - docs/architecture.md — module relationships to map ptychodus touchpoints.
  - docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md — two-system guidance + config bridging rules.
  - plans/pytorch_integration_test_plan.md — ensure integration plan aligns with upcoming PyTorch test scaffolding.
- Findings check: docs/findings.md has no PyTorch/Ptychodus entries; treat plan as greenfield.
- Coin flip review (heads): recent ~10 commits mostly metadata/sync; no PyTorch backend progress yet, so tighter guidance required.
- Authored phased plan at `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md`; captured dependencies, deliverables, and phase checklists.
- Updated docs/fix_plan.md to reference new plan and note Attempt #1.
- <Action State>: [ready_for_implementation]


## 2025-10-17T015135Z: Loop 3 — INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 housekeeping
- Focus issue: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001
- Action type: Review or housekeeping
- Mode: Docs
- Findings: Confirmed Phase A artifacts in `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T020000Z/{parity_map.md,summary.md}` and glossary at `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/glossary_and_ownership.md`; docs/findings.md has only CONFIG-001/MIGRATION-001 relevant to bridge.
- Plan upkeep: Marked Phase A checklist complete and expanded B1 guidance in `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md`; corrected fix plan Attempt #2 artifact path and logged Attempt #3 review entry.
- Steering: Rewrote `input.md` directing Ralph to draft Phase B config-bridge design under `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T021100Z/`, including mapping table + open questions log.
- Coin flip (heads): Reviewed Ralph commits (`git show e29e41d`, `git show 1a8a856`) — progress is documentation-centric, no regressions detected, but PyTorch code remains untouched.
- Open questions: Need a field-by-field singleton inventory for B2 failing test; expect Ralph to capture in new report.
- <Action State>: [ready_for_implementation]


## 2025-10-17T024638Z: Loop Planning Notes
- Focus issue: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000
- Action type: Planning
- Mode: Docs

- Findings check: `grep -n "PyTorch" docs/findings.md` returned none; no prior ledger entries to leverage.
- Document review emphasized `plans/ptychodus_pytorch_integration_plan.md`, `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md`, `specs/ptychodus_api_spec.md`, and `docs/workflows/pytorch.md` to scope the rebaseline needs.
- Coin flip → heads: reviewed recent commits (`git log --oneline -10`, `git show c14dfeb`, `git show a1bed82`); Ralph has only touched ledger sync, no Phase B artifacts yet.
- Authored new phased plan at `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000/implementation.md` and refreshed `docs/fix_plan.md` entry with Attempt #0.
- Reissued `input.md` directing Ralph to capture Phase A.A1 module inventory under `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000/reports/2025-10-17T025000Z/`.
- Next supervisor loop: confirm inventory artifacts exist, advance to Phase A.A2 delta tagging, then hand focus back to INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 once planning corpus is up to date.
- <Action State>: [planning]

## 2025-10-17T025541Z: Loop 5 Planning Update
- Focus issue: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000 (plan refresh)
- Action type: Planning

  - `plans/ptychodus_pytorch_integration_plan.md:3` (scope + deltas)
  - `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md:24` (downstream needs)
  - `specs/ptychodus_api_spec.md:1` (bridge contract)
- Updated governance plan status: marked B2 complete and C1/C3 done; expanded C2 guidance to require stakeholder brief before notifying other initiatives.
- Logged Attempt #4 in `docs/fix_plan.md:21` documenting this loop's prep; created artifact stub `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000/reports/2025-10-17T031500Z/brief_outline.md` to guide B.B3 execution.
- Rewrote `input.md` directing Ralph to author the stakeholder brief (`stakeholder_brief.md`) and capture open questions for Phase C.C2.
- Next steps for Ralph: produce the stakeholder brief, update docs/fix_plan Attempt #5 with evidence, and cascade key asks into `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md` once ready.
- <Action State>: [ready_for_implementation]

## 2025-10-17T032109Z: Pre-loop Focus Selection

## 2025-10-17T033500Z: Loop 7 Supervisory Update
- Focus issue: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 Phase B.B2 failing test directive
- Action type: Review or housekeeping
- Mode: TDD
- Findings check: `grep -n "CONFIG" docs/findings.md` → confirmed CONFIG-001 remains the key guardrail for params bridge.
- Coin flip = heads → Reviewed latest engineer commit (`f6224fa`) to confirm config schema mapping artifacts landed; work remains documentation-focused with no regressions observed.
- Plan upkeep: Marked Phase B.B1 complete and expanded B2 guidance in `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md:44-49`, defining the expected `ptycho_torch.config_bridge` adapter API.
- Ledger update: Added Attempt #6 in `docs/fix_plan.md` detailing this TDD directive and the target artifact directory `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T033500Z/`.
- Steering memo: Rewrote `input.md` instructing Ralph to author the failing test with xfail guard, capture pytest output, and document the red state per TDD.
- Next engineer steps: create `tests/torch/test_config_bridge.py`, run targeted pytest (expect fail), populate `failing_test.md` + `pytest.log`, and document any blocking decisions in scope_notes.md.
- <Action State>: [ready_for_implementation]

## 2025-10-17T034900Z: B3 Implementation Directive
- Focus issue: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 Phase B.B3 config bridge implementation; Action type: Review/housekeeping; Mode: TDD.
- Ran findings check (`rg "PyTorch" docs/findings.md`) — no prior ledger entries; proceeded using spec + plan sources.
- Marked B.B2 complete and refreshed Phase B table (`plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md:31-48`) so the plan reflects the authored failing test.
- Logged Attempt #8 in docs/fix_plan.md noting the upcoming implementation loop and pointing to artifact directory `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T034800Z/`.
- Rewrote input.md directing Ralph to implement `ptycho_torch.config_bridge` against the MVP nine-field contract (see failing_test.md) and to capture pytest output + bridge notes.
- Created report stub `bridge_notes.md` under the new timestamped directory for implementation artifacts.
- Expectation for Ralph: ship adapter, remove test xfail, run targeted pytest (accept skip if torch unavailable), document decisions in bridge_notes.md.
- <Action State>: [ready_for_implementation]

## 2025-10-17T040158Z: Loop 8 Focus Declaration
- Focus issue: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 Phase B.B3 config bridge MVP regression (ModelConfig/params mismatch)
- Action type: Debug
- Mode: none
- Notes: Beginning triage for config bridge implementation issues; detailed findings and next steps to follow before loop close.
- Evidence:
  - Confirmed `ModelConfig(**{'intensity_scale_trainable': False})` raises `TypeError` (`ptycho/config/config.py:96`); current adapter still forwards this kwarg.
  - Documented activation mismatch (`amp_activation='silu'`) referencing `ptycho_torch/config_params.py:45` and `ptycho/model.py:406-418`.
  - Captured findings + remediation checklist in `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T040158Z/config_bridge_debug.md`.
- Plan updates: Added Attempt #10 to `docs/fix_plan.md` and annotated B3 row in `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md` to point at the new debug report.
- Steering: Rewrote `input.md` directing Ralph to strip unsupported kwargs, normalize activation mapping, tighten override validation, and modify the test so it runs without needing real torch.
- Follow-up for Ralph: implement the bridge/test fixes, run the targeted pytest (capture output in the new artifact directory), and append a resolution section to the debug note.

## 2025-10-17T041908Z: B.B4 Parity Test Planning
- Focus issue: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 Phase B.B4 parity test expansion
- Action type: Planning
- Mode: Docs
- Actions: Authored phased roadmap at `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T041908Z/parity_test_plan.md` (field matrix, dataclass parity tests, params.cfg comparison, reporting). Updated `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md` B4 guidance and logged Attempt #12 in `docs/fix_plan.md`. Rewrote `input.md` instructing Ralph to derive the field matrix, add parameterized parity tests, and capture a red pytest run into the new artifact directory.
- Next supervisor check: confirm Ralph produced `field_matrix.md`, fixtures, red pytest log, and parity assertions; then plan implementation steps to flip failing cases green.
- <Action State>: [ready_for_implementation]
## 2025-10-17T050900Z: Focus Declaration
- Focus issue: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 Phase B.B5 parity green-phase plan
- Action type: Planning
- Mode: Docs
- Notes: Recording selections prior to documentation updates; full summary to follow at loop end.


- Findings check: `rg "CONFIG" docs/findings.md` → CONFIG-001 remains the guardrail for params.cfg sequencing (no new findings).
- Documentation review: leaned on `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T041908Z/summary.md` for P0/P1 prioritization, `config_schema_map.md` for field semantics, and `specs/ptychodus_api_spec.md` (§5) to confirm probe_mask/nphotons expectations. Noted torch-dependent import at `ptycho_torch/config_params.py:1` as primary harness blocker.
- Coin flip = heads → audited recent commits. `512205b` adds the parity matrix assets; `f7fb9f0` drops `train_debug.log` at repo root — flag for future cleanup/move under reports to avoid polluting top-level tree.
- Plan updates: Marked B4 complete in `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md` and recorded the new B5 row pointing at `reports/2025-10-17T050930Z/parity_green_plan.md`. Authored the green-phase plan detailing Phase A (torch shim), Phase B (probe_mask/nphotons), and downstream verification tasks.
- Ledger: Added Attempt #14 documenting the planning handoff; refreshed `input.md` directing Ralph to execute Phase A and capture `pytest_phaseA.log`.
- Follow-up for Ralph: Implement torch-optional import shim, update pytest gating per plan, run targeted selector, then proceed with probe_mask/nphotons fixes per Phase B.
- <Action State>: [planning]

## 2025-10-17T050007Z: Phase B.B5 P0 Evidence Pass
- Focus issue: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 Phase B.B5 (probe_mask/nphotons blockers)
- Action type: Evidence collection
- Mode: Parity
- Coin flip (heads): Reviewed last commits (`70b4c60`, `ecdd8a9`) — Ralph landed torch-optional shim + pytest log capture; parity tests now run but still failing, no regressions observed.
- Findings: Captured new artifacts in `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T045706Z/` (evidence_summary.md, pytest_param_failure.log, bridge_probe_mask_check.log). Verified parametrized tests fail due to unittest inheritance; confirmed `params.cfg['model_path']` stays `PosixPath`; noted probe_mask hardcoded False and nphotons default not enforced.
- Plan updates: `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md` B5 row now references the evidence summary; docs/fix_plan.md logged Attempt #16 with artifact links.
- Steering: Reissued `input.md` directing Ralph to convert parity tests to pytest style, normalize path/probe_mask/nphotons handling, and capture green pytest logs under `2025-10-17T045936Z`.
- Follow-up for Ralph: Implement P0 fixes per evidence summary, rerun targeted selectors, update reports + ledger, then proceed to n_subsample semantics once green.
- <Action State>: [ready_for_implementation]

## 2025-10-17T051640Z: Focus Setup
- Focus issue: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 Phase B.B5 parity harness alignment
- Action type: Review or housekeeping
- Mode: Parity
- Notes: Recording selections before artifact edits per instructions; full summary to follow after review.

- Review summary: Confirmed adapter P0 fixes landed (Attempt #17) but parity plan still showed Phase A open. Updated `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T050930Z/parity_green_plan.md` (Phase A marked complete, new B0 harness gate) and `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md` (B3 marked ✅, B5 guidance refreshed).
- Captured supervisor notes at `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T051750Z/status_review.md`; highlights pytest harness refactor + probe_mask/nphotons verification as next actions.
- Logged Attempt #18 in docs/fix_plan.md tying to the revised plan; rewrote input.md to focus Ralph on pytest refactor → targeted selectors (`pytest ...TestConfigBridgeParity`).
- Reminder: `train_debug.log` still at repo root from earlier loop—flagged in status review for relocation during implementation.
- Follow-up for Ralph: execute parity_green_plan Phase B0 conversion, capture logs in `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T052500Z/`, then advance B2/B4 once pytest harness passes.

## 2025-10-17T053919Z: Focus Declaration
- Focus issue: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 Phase B.B5 parity follow-through (probe_mask + nphotons validation)
- Action type: Review or housekeeping
- Mode: Parity
- Notes: Plan/tests review pass to stage probe_mask + nphotons parity work.
- Updates: implementation plan B5 guidance now points at Attempt #19 artefacts; parity green plan marks B0 complete and clarifies B2/B4 scope; created `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T054009Z/supervisor_summary.md` with next engineering actions; input.md rewritten for Attempt #21.
- Follow-up for Ralph: add probe_mask parity cases plus nphotons override error regression, record logs in the new report directory, and update ledger once tests run.
- <Action State>: [ready_for_implementation]
