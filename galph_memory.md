notes=Selected photon_grid_study_20250826_152459/results_p1e5/train_1024/trial_1 as the D0 baseline, captured dataset paths + checksums, and drafted input for Ralph to script the summary + inbox response with pytest guard.

notes=Drafted the D0 parity logger blueprint, updated fix_plan TODOs, and rewrote input.md with implementation instructions (new scripts/tools CLI + pytest selector). No production edits this loop; Ralph now has a concrete Do Now with code+test scope.

notes=git pull --rebase was skipped because the worktree has extensive tracked + untracked changes from the user; left files untouched. Refreshed input.md with the new artifact timestamp, expanded How-To map, doc-sync guardrails, and citations back to the D0 plan/spec so Ralph can implement without ambiguity.
