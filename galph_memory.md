# Galph Supervisor Memory

## 2025-10-16T230319Z: Initial entry
- No prior galph_memory.md existed; starting fresh after syncing with origin (repo already up to date).
- Required docs `specs/spec-a.md`, `arch.md`, `docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md`, and `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` are missing; note for future reconciliation with instructions.
- Coin flip (heads) triggered audit of last ~10 commits: recent work is primarily documentation and workflow setup; no evidence of the high-priority pytest triage or vectorization tasks being executed yet.
- Action type: Planning.
- Mode: none.
- Observations: docs/fix_plan.md still centers on PyTorch integration tasks and lacks items for current urgent goals.



## 2025-10-17T011918Z: Loop Planning Setup
- Focus issue: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 (PyTorch ↔ Ptychodus integration)
- Action type: Planning
- Mode: Docs
- Notes: Recorded selections prior to plan drafting.
- Reference docs for this loop:
  - specs/ptychodus_api_spec.md — authoritative reconstructor contract spanning config/data/persistence requirements.
  - plans/ptychodus_pytorch_integration_plan.md — prior parity map to salvage; needs restructuring.
  - docs/workflows/pytorch.md — current PyTorch workflow and parity guardrails.
  - docs/architecture.md — module relationships to map ptychodus touchpoints.
  - docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md — two-system guidance + config bridging rules.
  - plans/pytorch_integration_test_plan.md — ensure integration plan aligns with upcoming PyTorch test scaffolding.
- Findings check: docs/findings.md has no PyTorch/Ptychodus entries; treat plan as greenfield.
- Coin flip review (heads): recent ~10 commits mostly metadata/sync; no PyTorch backend progress yet, so tighter guidance required.
- Authored phased plan at `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md`; captured dependencies, deliverables, and phase checklists.
- Updated docs/fix_plan.md to reference new plan and note Attempt #1.
- <Action State>: [ready_for_implementation]

- Focus issue: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 Phase B.B5 parity green-phase plan
- Action type: Planning
- Mode: Docs
- Notes: Recording selections prior to documentation updates; full summary to follow at loop end.


- Findings check: `rg "CONFIG" docs/findings.md` → CONFIG-001 remains the guardrail for params.cfg sequencing (no new findings).
- Documentation review: leaned on `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T041908Z/summary.md` for P0/P1 prioritization, `config_schema_map.md` for field semantics, and `specs/ptychodus_api_spec.md` (§5) to confirm probe_mask/nphotons expectations. Noted torch-dependent import at `ptycho_torch/config_params.py:1` as primary harness blocker.
- Coin flip = heads → audited recent commits. `512205b` adds the parity matrix assets; `f7fb9f0` drops `train_debug.log` at repo root — flag for future cleanup/move under reports to avoid polluting top-level tree.
- Plan updates: Marked B4 complete in `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md` and recorded the new B5 row pointing at `reports/2025-10-17T050930Z/parity_green_plan.md`. Authored the green-phase plan detailing Phase A (torch shim), Phase B (probe_mask/nphotons), and downstream verification tasks.
- Ledger: Added Attempt #14 documenting the planning handoff; refreshed `input.md` directing Ralph to execute Phase A and capture `pytest_phaseA.log`.

## 2025-10-17T091152Z: Focus Declaration
- Focus issue: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 Phase D2 orchestration adapters
- Action type: Review or housekeeping
- Mode: Parity
- Notes: Recording selections before executing Step <3.2>. Detailed analysis to follow.

- Reference docs for this loop:
  - specs/ptychodus_api_spec.md — reconstructor lifecycle + config bridging obligations for orchestration.
  - docs/workflows/pytorch.md — PyTorch workflow parity/skip rules for backend hooks.
  - docs/architecture.md — baseline TensorFlow workflow map to mirror in PyTorch.
  - plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md — phase checklist; needs D1 status sync.
  - plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/phase_d_workflow.md — D2 task board with checklist IDs.
  - plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T085431Z/phase_d_callchain.md — TF callchain reference for parity.
  - plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T085431Z/phase_d_asset_inventory.md — inventory of reusable PyTorch modules guiding D2 scaffolding.
  - plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T085431Z/phase_d_decision.md — D1 decision selecting Option B (orchestration shims).
  - ptycho/workflows/components.py — TensorFlow orchestration source for parity cues.
- Findings: CONFIG-001/MIGRATION-001/DATA-001 remain active constraints; per phase_d_decision Option B shims require new module `ptycho_torch/workflows/components.py`. Checked D1 artifacts (callchain, asset inventory, decision) and used them to scope D2.A.
- Housekeeping: Marked D1.A–C complete in `phase_d_workflow.md` and D1 row in implementation plan to keep checklists authoritative.
- Steering: Rewrote `input.md` (Parity mode) directing Ralph to TDD scaffolding (`tests/torch/test_workflows_components.py`) and torch-optional module skeleton; artifacts expected under `reports/2025-10-17T091450Z/`.
- docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #42 logs this setup; focus remains INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 Phase D2.A.
- Follow-up for Ralph: 1) add targeted pytest to confirm `update_legacy_dict` call, 2) create guarded scaffolding module + exports, 3) capture logs/notes in new report folder.
