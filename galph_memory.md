# Galph Supervisor Memory

## 2025-10-16T230319Z: Initial entry
- No prior galph_memory.md existed; starting fresh after syncing with origin (repo already up to date).
- Required docs `specs/spec-a.md`, `arch.md`, `docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md`, and `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` are missing; note for future reconciliation with instructions.
- Coin flip (heads) triggered audit of last ~10 commits: recent work is primarily documentation and workflow setup; no evidence of the high-priority pytest triage or vectorization tasks being executed yet.
- Action type: Planning.
- Mode: none.
- Observations: docs/fix_plan.md still centers on PyTorch integration tasks and lacks items for current urgent goals.



## 2025-10-17T011918Z: Loop Planning Setup
- Focus issue: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 (PyTorch ↔ Ptychodus integration)
- Action type: Planning
- Mode: Docs
- Notes: Recorded selections prior to plan drafting.
- Reference docs for this loop:
  - specs/ptychodus_api_spec.md — authoritative reconstructor contract spanning config/data/persistence requirements.
  - plans/ptychodus_pytorch_integration_plan.md — prior parity map to salvage; needs restructuring.
  - docs/workflows/pytorch.md — current PyTorch workflow and parity guardrails.
  - docs/architecture.md — module relationships to map ptychodus touchpoints.
  - docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md — two-system guidance + config bridging rules.
  - plans/pytorch_integration_test_plan.md — ensure integration plan aligns with upcoming PyTorch test scaffolding.
- Findings check: docs/findings.md has no PyTorch/Ptychodus entries; treat plan as greenfield.
- Coin flip review (heads): recent ~10 commits mostly metadata/sync; no PyTorch backend progress yet, so tighter guidance required.
- Authored phased plan at `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md`; captured dependencies, deliverables, and phase checklists.
- Updated docs/fix_plan.md to reference new plan and note Attempt #1.
- <Action State>: [ready_for_implementation]
