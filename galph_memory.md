# Galph Supervisor Memory

## 2025-10-16T230319Z: Initial entry
- No prior galph_memory.md existed; starting fresh after syncing with origin (repo already up to date).
- Required docs `specs/spec-a.md`, `arch.md`, `docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md`, and `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` are missing; note for future reconciliation with instructions.
- Coin flip (heads) triggered audit of last ~10 commits: recent work is primarily documentation and workflow setup; no evidence of the high-priority pytest triage or vectorization tasks being executed yet.
- Action type: Planning.
- Mode: none.
- Observations: docs/fix_plan.md still centers on PyTorch integration tasks and lacks items for current urgent goals.
