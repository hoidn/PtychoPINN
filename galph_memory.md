# Galph Supervisor Memory

## 2025-10-16T230319Z: Initial entry
- No prior galph_memory.md existed; starting fresh after syncing with origin (repo already up to date).
- Required docs `specs/spec-a.md`, `arch.md`, `docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md`, and `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` are missing; note for future reconciliation with instructions.
- Coin flip (heads) triggered audit of last ~10 commits: recent work is primarily documentation and workflow setup; no evidence of the high-priority pytest triage or vectorization tasks being executed yet.
- Selected focus issue: `TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE` (run full pytest suite, triage failures, plan fixes).
- Action type: Planning.
- Mode: none.
- Observations: docs/fix_plan.md still centers on PyTorch integration tasks and lacks items for current urgent goals.

## 2025-10-16T230611Z: Planning deliverables
- Authored `plans/active/TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE/plan.md` with phased approach (Phase A baseline run, Phase B classification, Phase C delegation).
- Added `[TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE]` item to `docs/fix_plan.md` and updated Active Focus to emphasize restoring pytest signal.
- Wrote supervisor handoff in `input.md` instructing Ralph to run `pytest tests/ -vv` and capture artifacts under timestamped reports directory.
- Noted missing docs referenced in global instructions (`specs/spec-a.md`, `arch.md`, `docs/development/*`); no action yet beyond awareness.
