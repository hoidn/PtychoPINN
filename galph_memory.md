# Galph Supervisor Memory

## 2025-10-16T230319Z: Initial entry
- No prior galph_memory.md existed; starting fresh after syncing with origin (repo already up to date).
- Required docs `specs/spec-a.md`, `arch.md`, `docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md`, and `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` are missing; note for future reconciliation with instructions.
- Coin flip (heads) triggered audit of last ~10 commits: recent work is primarily documentation and workflow setup; no evidence of the high-priority pytest triage or vectorization tasks being executed yet.
- Action type: Planning.
- Mode: none.
- Observations: docs/fix_plan.md still centers on PyTorch integration tasks and lacks items for current urgent goals.



## 2025-10-17T011918Z: Loop Planning Setup
- Focus issue: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 (PyTorch ↔ Ptychodus integration)
- Action type: Planning
- Mode: Docs
- Notes: Recorded selections prior to plan drafting.
- Reference docs for this loop:
  - specs/ptychodus_api_spec.md — authoritative reconstructor contract spanning config/data/persistence requirements.
  - plans/ptychodus_pytorch_integration_plan.md — prior parity map to salvage; needs restructuring.
  - docs/workflows/pytorch.md — current PyTorch workflow and parity guardrails.
  - docs/architecture.md — module relationships to map ptychodus touchpoints.
  - docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md — two-system guidance + config bridging rules.
  - plans/pytorch_integration_test_plan.md — ensure integration plan aligns with upcoming PyTorch test scaffolding.
- Findings check: docs/findings.md has no PyTorch/Ptychodus entries; treat plan as greenfield.
- Coin flip review (heads): recent ~10 commits mostly metadata/sync; no PyTorch backend progress yet, so tighter guidance required.
- Authored phased plan at `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md`; captured dependencies, deliverables, and phase checklists.
- Updated docs/fix_plan.md to reference new plan and note Attempt #1.
- <Action State>: [ready_for_implementation]


## 2025-10-17T015135Z: Loop 3 — INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 housekeeping
- Focus issue: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001
- Action type: Review or housekeeping
- Mode: Docs
- Findings: Confirmed Phase A artifacts in `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T020000Z/{parity_map.md,summary.md}` and glossary at `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/glossary_and_ownership.md`; docs/findings.md has only CONFIG-001/MIGRATION-001 relevant to bridge.
- Plan upkeep: Marked Phase A checklist complete and expanded B1 guidance in `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md`; corrected fix plan Attempt #2 artifact path and logged Attempt #3 review entry.
- Steering: Rewrote `input.md` directing Ralph to draft Phase B config-bridge design under `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T021100Z/`, including mapping table + open questions log.
- Coin flip (heads): Reviewed Ralph commits (`git show e29e41d`, `git show 1a8a856`) — progress is documentation-centric, no regressions detected, but PyTorch code remains untouched.
- Open questions: Need a field-by-field singleton inventory for B2 failing test; expect Ralph to capture in new report.
- <Action State>: [ready_for_implementation]


## 2025-10-17T024638Z: Loop Planning Notes
- Focus issue: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000
- Action type: Planning
- Mode: Docs

- Findings check: `grep -n "PyTorch" docs/findings.md` returned none; no prior ledger entries to leverage.
- Document review emphasized `plans/ptychodus_pytorch_integration_plan.md`, `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md`, `specs/ptychodus_api_spec.md`, and `docs/workflows/pytorch.md` to scope the rebaseline needs.
- Coin flip → heads: reviewed recent commits (`git log --oneline -10`, `git show c14dfeb`, `git show a1bed82`); Ralph has only touched ledger sync, no Phase B artifacts yet.
- Authored new phased plan at `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000/implementation.md` and refreshed `docs/fix_plan.md` entry with Attempt #0.
- Reissued `input.md` directing Ralph to capture Phase A.A1 module inventory under `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000/reports/2025-10-17T025000Z/`.
- Next supervisor loop: confirm inventory artifacts exist, advance to Phase A.A2 delta tagging, then hand focus back to INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 once planning corpus is up to date.
- <Action State>: [planning]

## 2025-10-17T025541Z: Loop 5 Planning Update
- Focus issue: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000 (plan refresh)
- Action type: Planning
- Mode: Docs
- Artifacts: `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000/reports/2025-10-17T025633Z/{plan_redline.md,summary.md}`; updated plan checklist + fix ledger Attempt #2.
- Key actions: Marked Phase A complete, executed Phase B.B1 redline draft, refreshed implementation plan guidance, and added Attempt #2 in docs/fix_plan.md with revised exit-criteria notes.
- Next directives for Ralph: Execute Phase B.B2 canonical edits using the redline outline, then prepare stakeholder brief (B.B3).
- Open questions: Need decisions on API surface vs low-level integration and persistence format (captured in redline D1-D3).
- <Action State>: [planning] — Next supervisor loop must advance to [ready_for_implementation] or shift focus.

## 2025-10-17T031028Z: Loop 6 Pre-Work Notes
- Focus issue: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000 — Phase C governance handoff alignment.
- Action type: Review or housekeeping.
- Mode: Docs.
- Status: Pre-analysis checkpoint recorded before edits.
- Findings ledger check: `grep -n "CONFIG" docs/findings.md` → CONFIG-001 (params bridge) remains only relevant entry; no PyTorch-specific records yet.
- Documentation review anchored on:
  - `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000/implementation.md:24` (Phase B/C tasks)
  - `plans/ptychodus_pytorch_integration_plan.md:3` (scope + deltas)
  - `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md:24` (downstream needs)
  - `specs/ptychodus_api_spec.md:1` (bridge contract)
- Updated governance plan status: marked B2 complete and C1/C3 done; expanded C2 guidance to require stakeholder brief before notifying other initiatives.
- Logged Attempt #4 in `docs/fix_plan.md:21` documenting this loop's prep; created artifact stub `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000/reports/2025-10-17T031500Z/brief_outline.md` to guide B.B3 execution.
- Rewrote `input.md` directing Ralph to author the stakeholder brief (`stakeholder_brief.md`) and capture open questions for Phase C.C2.
- Next steps for Ralph: produce the stakeholder brief, update docs/fix_plan Attempt #5 with evidence, and cascade key asks into `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md` once ready.
- <Action State>: [ready_for_implementation]

## 2025-10-17T032109Z: Pre-loop Focus Selection
- Focus issue: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 Phase B1 configuration schema audit
- Action type: Evidence collection
- Mode: Docs

## 2025-10-17T032344Z: Supervisory Evidence Directive
- Focus issue: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 Phase B.B1 configuration schema audit; prepped evidence loop for Ralph.
- Key references: specs/ptychodus_api_spec.md:61-149, ptycho/config/config.py:72-178, ptycho_torch/config_params.py:8-128, plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md:46, and stakeholder brief delta 1.
- Updated input.md to point Ralph at `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T032218Z/` for `config_schema_map.md` + `scope_notes.md`; clarified use of KEY_MAPPINGS and params.cfg dotted keys.
- Logged Attempt #4 in docs/fix_plan.md noting this evidence prep and artifact expectations.
- Next supervisor check: confirm artifacts exist, review MVP vs parity decisions, then green-light Phase B.B2 failing test authoring.
