Summary: Capture the Phase C stakeholder brief so INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 can act on the refreshed integration plan.
Mode: Docs
Focus: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000 — Pre-refresh Planning for PyTorch Backend Integration
Branch: feature/torchapi
Mapped tests: none — docs-only
Artifacts: plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000/reports/2025-10-17T031500Z/{brief_outline.md,stakeholder_brief.md}
Do Now: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000 — Phase C.C2 stakeholder brief; author `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000/reports/2025-10-17T031500Z/stakeholder_brief.md` summarizing canonical plan deltas and actionable asks for INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 and TEST-PYTORCH-001.
If Blocked: Log roadblocks in `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000/reports/2025-10-17T031500Z/open_questions.md`, update docs/fix_plan.md Attempts History, and stop.
Priorities & Rationale:
- `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000/implementation.md:42` — Phase C requires a stakeholder brief before notifying downstream initiatives.
- `docs/fix_plan.md:9` — Attempt #4 documents the governance kickoff and expects this brief next.
- `plans/ptychodus_pytorch_integration_plan.md:3` — Scope highlights dual-backend goals the brief must communicate.
- `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md:24` — Upcoming Phase B work depends on clear configuration-bridge directives from the brief.
- `specs/ptychodus_api_spec.md:1` — Configuration bridge rules that must be cited when framing the asks.
How-To Map:
- Re-read the updated canonical plan focusing on Sections 1–4 to extract the five major deltas (API surface, config schema, data adapters, orchestration, persistence).
- Summarize each delta into `stakeholder_brief.md` with subsections: Context, Required Action (per initiative), and Outstanding Questions; cite `CONFIG-001` for the configuration bridge urgency.
- Include a checklist table mapping delta → initiative → due diligence, leveraging the outline in `brief_outline.md`.
- Close with explicit next steps for INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 Phase B (config design + failing test) and TEST-PYTORCH-001 fixture alignment, referencing relevant plan rows.
- When complete, note the artifact path in docs/fix_plan.md under Attempt #5 and mention key highlights in `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md` if decisions alter that plan.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not modify production code or non-doc assets this loop.
- Keep edits within the artifact folder and docs ledger; avoid touching canonical plan unless inaccuracies surface.
- Maintain ASCII formatting; no fancy bullets beyond Markdown standard.
- Cite spec/plan line numbers when asserting requirements to prevent drift.
- Highlight open questions rather than resolving them silently.
- Avoid inventing new initiative IDs; reuse existing plan labels.
- Keep stakeholder brief actionable—no narrative fluff or rehash of entire plan.
- Confirm artifact filenames match the ones listed above before finishing.
- If referencing tests, quote selectors from authoritative docs only.
Pointers:
- `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000/implementation.md:37`
- `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000/reports/2025-10-17T031500Z/brief_outline.md`
- `plans/ptychodus_pytorch_integration_plan.md:20`
- `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md:29`
- `docs/fix_plan.md:21`
- `specs/ptychodus_api_spec.md:61`
Next Up: 1) Update `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md` with stakeholder brief actions; 2) Shift focus to TEST-PYTORCH-001 fixture planning if bandwidth remains.
