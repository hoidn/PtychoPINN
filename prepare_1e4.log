--- Step 0: Padding to Even Dimensions ---
--- Processing for even dimensions: tike_outputs/fly001/fly001_reconstructed.npz ---
Padding array from (231, 231) to (232, 232)...
'probeGuess' already has even dimensions. No changes made.
Saving processed data to: prepare_1e4_photons/stages/01_padded/fly001_reconstructed_padded.npz
--- Padding Complete ---

--- Step 1: Canonicalizing NPZ Format ---
Loading data from: prepare_1e4_photons/stages/01_padded/fly001_reconstructed_padded.npz
Processing 8 arrays...
  - Renaming 'diff3d' to 'diffraction'
âœ” Saved consistently formatted data to: prepare_1e4_photons/stages/02_transposed/fly001_reconstructed_transposed.npz

--- Step 2: Interpolating Data (2x Zoom) ---
Loading data from: prepare_1e4_photons/stages/02_transposed/fly001_reconstructed_transposed.npz
Identified Probe: 'probeGuess' (shape: (64, 64))
Identified Object: 'objectGuess' (shape: (232, 232))
Interpolating array from (64, 64) with zoom factor 2.0...
  New shape: (128, 128)
Interpolating array from (232, 232) with zoom factor 2.0...
  New shape: (464, 464)
Saving new NPZ file to: prepare_1e4_photons/stages/03_interpolated/fly001_reconstructed_interpolated_2x.npz

--- Step 3: Smoothing Probe (No-Op, sigma=0) ---
Loading data from: prepare_1e4_photons/stages/03_interpolated/fly001_reconstructed_interpolated_2x.npz
Identified Probe: 'probeGuess' (shape: (128, 128))
Identified Object: 'objectGuess' (shape: (464, 464))
Applying Gaussian filter to complex array of shape (128, 128) (sigma=0.0)...
- Amplitude and unwrapped phase smoothed.

--- Step 4: Smoothing Object (sigma=0.5) ---
Loading data from: prepare_1e4_photons/stages/04_smooth_probe/fly001_reconstructed_interp_smooth_probe.npz
Identified Probe: 'probeGuess' (shape: (128, 128))
Identified Object: 'objectGuess' (shape: (464, 464))
Applying Gaussian filter to complex array of shape (464, 464) (sigma=0.5)...
