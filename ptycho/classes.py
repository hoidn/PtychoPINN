"""
Reserved module for custom data structure and class definitions.

This module serves as a designated placeholder for future object-oriented components
in the PtychoPINN system. Currently empty, it is reserved for class definitions that
would provide structured alternatives to the existing functional architecture.

Architecture Role:
    Future: Functional modules -> classes.py (data structures) -> Structured interfaces
    Current: Placeholder module with no active functionality
    
    When developed, this module would bridge functional components with structured
    data containers and type-safe interfaces for improved code organization.

Public Interface:
    Currently empty - no classes or functions are defined.
    
    Future candidates for implementation:
    - `PtychoDataContainer`: Structured data holders with validation
    - `ReconstructionResult`: Type-safe containers for model outputs  
    - `ConfigurationWrapper`: Enhanced parameter containers

Development Status:
    This module is intentionally empty and serves as a placeholder for future
    object-oriented development. The current PtychoPINN system operates using
    a functional/procedural architecture with dictionary-based data passing.

Workflow Usage Example:
    ```python
    # Current state: Module import will succeed but provides no functionality
    import ptycho.classes  # Valid import, no classes available
    
    # Future intended usage (not yet implemented):
    # from ptycho.classes import PtychoDataContainer
    # dataset = PtychoDataContainer.from_npz('data.npz')
    ```

Architectural Notes:
- Reserved for future structured data containers and model wrappers
- Intended to provide type-safe alternatives to dictionary-based data flows
- Should integrate with existing ptycho.loader and ptycho.config modules
- Development should prioritize data structures over behavioral complexity
