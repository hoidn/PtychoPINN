Core Data Structure Definitions for PtychoPINN

This module is intended to contain class definitions for core data structures, containers, 
and specialized objects used throughout the PtychoPINN system. It serves as a central 
location for shared data types and abstractions.

Intended Class Categories:
  - Data containers: Structured holders for ptychographic data with validation
  - Configuration objects: Type-safe parameter containers beyond basic dataclasses
  - Result containers: Standardized formats for reconstruction outputs and metrics
  - Custom tensor wrappers: Domain-specific tensor abstractions with physics metadata
  - Protocol definitions: Interface specifications for extensible components

Architecture Integration:
  This module would provide the foundational data types that bridge different components 
  of the PtychoPINN system, offering more structured alternatives to dictionary-based 
  data passing and numpy array handling. Classes defined here would be consumed across 
  all system tiers.

Development Status:
  Currently empty. The module serves as a placeholder for future object-oriented 
  development as the system evolves from its current functional/procedural architecture 
  toward more structured class-based designs.

Design Principles for Future Development:
  - Immutable data containers where possible for thread safety
  - Clear separation of data and behavior (prefer data classes over heavy objects)
  - Integration with existing numpy/TensorFlow tensor operations
  - Backward compatibility with current dictionary-based data flows
  - Type hints and validation for improved development experience

Intended Usage Patterns:
  ```python
  # Future intended usage
  from ptycho.classes import PtychoDataSet, ReconstructionResult
  
  # Structured data containers
  dataset = PtychoDataSet.from_npz(file_path, validation=True)
  
  # Type-safe result handling
  result = ReconstructionResult(
      amplitude=amp_array, 
      phase=phase_array, 
      metrics=evaluation_metrics
  )
  ```

Integration Considerations:
  Future class development should consider integration with:
  - Existing ptycho.loader.PtychoDataContainer functionality
  - Modern ptycho.config dataclass-based configuration system
  - TensorFlow data pipeline requirements
  - Jupyter notebook interactive workflows

Notes:
  - Module currently contains no active code
  - Development should prioritize data structures over complex behavior
  - Consider using dataclasses and attrs for implementation
  - Maintain compatibility with both legacy and modern system components
