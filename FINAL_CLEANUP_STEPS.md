# Final Steps to Complete Repository Cleanup

## Current Status
- ✅ NPZ files removed from tracking
- ✅ .gitignore updated to prevent future commits
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks installed
- ✅ Documentation created
- ✅ git filter-branch completed to rewrite history
- ⚠️ Git objects still contain large files (3.4GB)
- ❌ Push to GitHub still blocked by large files

## Manual Steps Required

### Step 1: Complete the Cleanup
Run these commands in sequence:

```bash
# 1. Remove filter-branch backups
rm -rf .git/refs/original/

# 2. Expire all reflogs immediately
git reflog expire --expire-unreachable=now --all

# 3. Repack and prune aggressively
git repack -Ad
git prune --expire=now

# 4. Check the new size
du -sh .git
```

### Step 2: If Still Too Large - Nuclear Option
If the repository is still large, use this more aggressive approach:

```bash
# Create a clean clone without the large files
cd ~/Documents
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hoidn/PtychoPINN.git PtychoPINN-shallow
cd PtychoPINN-shallow

# Cherry-pick your recent commits (without NPZ files)
git cherry-pick 5a5cf30  # Remove NPZ data files and add data management safeguards
git cherry-pick 74ae479  # Add README warning and git history cleanup script
git cherry-pick 43b7f6b  # Add emergency fix documentation

# Push the clean branch
git push origin HEAD:clean-no-history --force
```

### Step 3: Alternative - Create Patch and Apply
If the above doesn't work:

```bash
# In your current directory
cd ~/Documents/PtychoPINN2

# Export your work as patches
git format-patch origin/feature/high-performance-patch-extraction..HEAD

# Clone fresh and apply
cd ~/Documents
git clone https://github.com/hoidn/PtychoPINN.git PtychoPINN-fresh
cd PtychoPINN-fresh
git checkout -b feature/clean-high-performance

# Apply your patches
git am ~/Documents/PtychoPINN2/*.patch

# Push the clean branch
git push origin feature/clean-high-performance
```

## What Worked

The following has been successfully implemented:

1. **Prevention System**:
   - `.gitignore` blocks all data files
   - Pre-commit hook prevents large file commits
   - Documentation guides team on proper data management

2. **Cleanup Documentation**:
   - `docs/DATA_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete guide
   - `scripts/setup_git_hooks.sh` - Hook installer
   - `scripts/clean_git_history.sh` - Cleanup script
   - `EMERGENCY_FIX.md` - Emergency procedures

## Next Actions

1. **Complete the manual cleanup** using the commands above
2. **Test push** with: `git push origin --dry-run`
3. **Coordinate with team** before force pushing
4. **Consider GitHub LFS** for any legitimate large files

## Team Communication

After successful cleanup:

```
Team,

The repository has been cleaned of large NPZ files that were blocking pushes.

Required Actions:
1. Re-clone the repository or run:
   git fetch origin
   git reset --hard origin/<your-branch>

2. Install protection:
   ./scripts/setup_git_hooks.sh

3. Never commit data files - see docs/DATA_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md

The repository now has safeguards against future data file commits.
```

## If All Else Fails

1. Contact GitHub support for temporary size limit increase
2. Create a new repository with clean history
3. Archive the old repository with a notice about the move
