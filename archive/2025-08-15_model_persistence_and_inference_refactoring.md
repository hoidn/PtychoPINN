# Model Persistence Testing and Inference Configuration Refactoring Session
**Date**: 2025-08-15  
**Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Participants**: Developer + AI Assistant

## Session Overview

This session focused on two major tasks:
1. Implementing comprehensive model persistence tests to validate the save/load workflow
2. Investigating and refactoring redundant configuration handling in the inference pipeline

## Part 1: Model Persistence Test Implementation

### Objective
Create a robust set of automated tests to validate the entire model training, saving, loading, and inference workflow, with special focus on ensuring the model's configuration is correctly persisted and restored.

### Context Review
- Reviewed project documentation: README.md, scripts/studies/README.md
- Identified lack of DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md and data_contracts.md (not found)
- Examined existing test structure in `/tests` directory

### Implementation

#### 1. Created `tests/test_model_manager_persistence.py`
**Purpose**: Unit tests for ModelManager class focusing on parameter and architecture restoration

**Key Tests Implemented**:
- **Parameter Restoration Test**: Verifies that loading a model restores its saved `params.cfg`, overwriting the current session's configuration
- **Architecture-Aware Loading Test**: Tests that a model's architecture is correctly rebuilt based on parameters restored from saved artifact (e.g., gridsize compatibility)
- **Inference Consistency Test**: Ensures loaded models produce identical outputs to original models for the same inputs

**Technical Challenges**:
- TensorFlow GPU initialization conflicts when running through unittest
- Global state dependencies requiring probe initialization before model import
- Solution: Initialize probe before importing model modules

```python
# Required initialization sequence
from ptycho import params as p
from ptycho.probe import get_default_probe

p.set('N', 64)
p.set('probe.type', 'gaussian')
probe = get_default_probe(64)
p.params()['probe'] = probe

# NOW safe to import model modules
from ptycho.model import create_model_with_gridsize
```

#### 2. Created `tests/test_integration_workflow.py`
**Purpose**: End-to-end integration test simulating real user workflow across separate processes

**Test Coverage**:
- Complete train → save → load → infer cycle
- Validates model artifact creation during training
- Verifies successful model loading in inference script
- Checks output image generation

**Result**: ✅ Test passes successfully (~37 seconds runtime)

#### 3. Created Supporting Test Documentation
- `tests/README_PERSISTENCE_TESTS.md`: Comprehensive guide for the test suite
- Documents known issues with TensorFlow initialization
- Provides workarounds and best practices

### Key Findings
- Model persistence layer working correctly
- Parameters are properly saved and restored
- Architecture is correctly reconstructed based on saved parameters
- Inference produces consistent results after save/load cycle

## Part 2: Inference Configuration Refactoring

### Investigation Phase

#### Objective
Determine if the practice of overwriting global probe configuration during inference serves a valid purpose, and if configuration updates before model loading are necessary.

#### Hypothesis
Two potentially redundant operations in `scripts/inference/inference.py`:
1. `update_legacy_dict(params.cfg, config)` before model loading
2. `probe.set_probe_guess(None, test_data.probeGuess)` in perform_inference (already removed)

#### Investigation Methodology

##### Code Flow Analysis
Traced the execution sequence:
1. `load_model()` is called
2. `ModelManager.load_multiple_models()` executes
3. `params.cfg.update(loaded_params)` at line 119 of model_manager.py
4. Model created with `create_model_with_gridsize()`
5. Model weights loaded from saved file
6. ProbeIllumination layer's tf.Variable already initialized

##### Key Insight
The ProbeIllumination layer's `self.w` is a tf.Variable that:
- Gets initial value from `p.cfg['probe']` when model.py is imported
- Gets overwritten with saved weights when model is loaded
- Is NOT affected by later changes to `p.cfg['probe']`

### Verification Phase

#### Created Verification Tests

1. **`test_probe_hypothesis.py`**: Attempted to verify probe setting has no effect on loaded model
   - Issue: TensorFlow initialization conflicts prevented execution

2. **`test_probe_hypothesis_simple.py`**: Code flow analysis proving the hypothesis through logic

3. **`test_inference_logging_simple.py`**: Configuration flow test demonstrating:
   - `update_legacy_dict()` sets gridsize from config (999 → 1)
   - `ModelManager.load_model()` overwrites it with saved value (1 → 2)
   - Therefore, initial update is redundant

4. **`inference_instrumented.py`**: Instrumented version with debug logging
   - Added logging at key points to track configuration changes
   - Confirmed model's configuration is authoritative

### Refactoring Phase

#### Changes Made to `scripts/inference/inference.py`

1. **Removed redundant probe setting** (previous session):
```python
# REMOVED:
probe.set_probe_guess(None, test_data.probeGuess)

# REPLACED WITH:
# The model loaded by the caller already contains the correct trained probe.
# There is no need to set it again from the test data...
```

2. **Removed redundant config update** (this session):
```python
# REMOVED:
update_legacy_dict(params.cfg, config)

# REPLACED WITH:
# Note: update_legacy_dict() removed - ModelManager.load_model() will restore
# the authoritative configuration from the saved model artifact...
```

### Validation Phase

#### Test Results

1. **Integration Test**: ✅ PASSED (36 seconds)
   - Full workflow still functions correctly
   - Model training, saving, loading, and inference work as expected

2. **Output Comparison Test** (`compare_inference_outputs.py`):
   - Compared outputs with and without `update_legacy_dict()`
   - Result: Pixel-perfect identical outputs
   - Confirms refactoring has no behavioral impact

3. **Performance**: No change in execution time

## Technical Insights Gained

### Global State Management Issues
The project has significant global state dependencies:
- Model module expects probe initialized at import time
- Parameters stored in global `params.cfg` dictionary
- TensorFlow GPU settings modified at module import

### Model Loading Architecture
- ModelManager properly saves/restores full configuration
- Saved parameters are authoritative over runtime configuration
- Model's internal tf.Variables are independent of global config after loading

### Testing Challenges
- TensorFlow's eager execution and GPU initialization create test isolation issues
- Solution: Run tests in subprocesses or standalone scripts
- Consider refactoring to reduce global state dependencies

   - Use dependency injection instead of global configuration
   
2. **Improve Test Infrastructure**:
   - Create test fixtures for proper TensorFlow initialization
   - Implement test isolation to avoid GPU conflicts
   - Add smaller test datasets for faster testing

3. **Documentation**:
   - Create missing DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md

- Clearer code intent (model's saved state is authoritative)
- Reduced cognitive load (fewer misleading operations)

## Conclusion

This session successfully accomplished both primary objectives:
1. Created a robust test suite for model persistence validation
2. Identified and safely removed redundant configuration code

The refactoring improves code clarity and accuracy while maintaining identical functionality, as proven by comprehensive testing. The work provides a solid foundation for future development and establishes better testing practices for the project.
