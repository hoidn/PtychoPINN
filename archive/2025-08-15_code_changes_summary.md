# Code Changes Summary - 2025-08-15

## Files Modified

### 1. `/scripts/inference/inference.py`

#### Change 1: Removed probe.set_probe_guess() call
**Location**: Line ~180 in `perform_inference()` function  
**Previous Code**:
```python
# Set probe guess
probe.set_probe_guess(None, test_data.probeGuess)
```

**New Code**:
```python
# The model loaded by the caller already contains the correct trained probe.
# There is no need to set it again from the test data, as that would be
# both misleading and ineffectual - the model's internal tf.Variable probe
# is not affected by changes to the global configuration after loading.
# [Removed: probe.set_probe_guess(None, test_data.probeGuess)]
```

**Rationale**: The ProbeIllumination layer's tf.Variable is restored from saved weights and is not affected by subsequent changes to the global configuration.

#### Change 2: Removed update_legacy_dict() call
**Location**: Line ~478 in `main()` function  
**Previous Code**:
```python
# Update global params with new-style config
update_legacy_dict(params.cfg, config)
```

**New Code**:
```python
# Note: update_legacy_dict() removed - ModelManager.load_model() will restore
# the authoritative configuration from the saved model artifact, making this
# initial update redundant. The loaded model's params take precedence.
```

**Rationale**: ModelManager.load_model() calls params.cfg.update(loaded_params), which overwrites any previous configuration, making the initial update redundant.

## Impact Analysis

### Behavioral Changes
- **None** - The refactored code produces identical outputs

### Performance Impact
- **Negligible** - Removed two unnecessary operations

### Code Quality Improvements
1. **Clarity**: Code now accurately reflects that the model uses its saved configuration
2. **Simplicity**: Removed redundant operations that had no effect
3. **Maintainability**: Fewer misleading operations reduce confusion

## Validation Results

| Test | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Integration Test | ✅ PASS | Full train→save→load→infer cycle works |
| Output Comparison | ✅ IDENTICAL | Pixel-perfect match with/without changes |
| Runtime Performance | ✅ NO CHANGE | ~36 seconds for integration test |

refactor(inference): Remove redundant configuration operations

Remove two ineffectual configuration operations from inference pipeline:

1. probe.set_probe_guess() - The model's internal tf.Variable probe is
   not affected by global config changes after loading

2. update_legacy_dict() - ModelManager.load_model() overwrites this
   with saved parameters, making the initial update redundant

These changes improve code clarity by removing misleading operations
that suggested configuration was being modified when it had no effect.
The model's saved state is and always was authoritative.

Validated with:
- Integration tests pass
- Output comparison shows pixel-perfect identical results
- No behavioral changes

Tests added:
- tests/test_model_manager_persistence.py
- tests/test_integration_workflow.py
```
