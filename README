TODOs

* make the model robust to arbitrary scaling/incorrect normalization of the diffracted intensity
* other ideas: fft based loss, gradient loss, vq-vae https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/style_transfer#define_content_and_style_representations
* probe-based vs reconstruction-based support?

* Use perceptual loss for reconstruction. Need to set the weights. Read Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer
and Super-Resolution
* Reflection invariance: do augmentation to reflect this. (done / n/a)
* consistency check on magnitude constraint (done)
* Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation, explore and discuss. Make a slide explaining the idea.
* Try MC Dropout https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.02680.pdf
* Put poisson likelihood into data (done)
* read deep ensembles https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01474.pdf
* overlap condition -> resolution? 
* what does trainable option do?
* paper that ashwin mentioned


* sub-pixel shifting
* lit review
* hard constraint on diffraction norm using projection, consider tf.keras.constraints.MinMaxNorm
* stochastic probe
* probe symmetry consequences
* add an object normalization layer that uses the L2 norm
* how do super resolution models handle high resolutions?
* shift invariance
* grid permutation
* fourier ring correlation

high priority (descending):

* metric comparison for both training and eval (inc. with 50 percent cutoff frequency of mtf)
* probe fitting
* study robustness impact of Poisson likelihood
