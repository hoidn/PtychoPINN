# Comparison Script Silent Failure Issue

## Problem Summary

The model comparison script (`scripts/compare_models.py`) runs without errors but produces no output files. This presents as a "successful run with no output" pattern that typically indicates silent failures in data processing loops or control flow bugs.

## Symptoms

- **Script execution**: Appears to complete successfully without throwing errors
- **Missing outputs**: No generation of expected files:
  - `comparison_metrics.csv` (quantitative metrics)
  - Visualization plots (PNG files)
  - Reconstruction NPZ files (raw and aligned data)
- **Empty directories**: All output directories remain empty after execution
- **Model loading**: Both individual models load successfully when tested independently

## Models Involved

- **PINN Model**: `comparison_gs2_10k_train/pinn_run/wts.h5.zip`
  - Architecture expects: `(None, 64, 64, 1)` - 1-channel input (gridsize=1 format)
- **Baseline Model**: `comparison_gs2_10k_train/baseline_run/baseline_model.h5`
  - Architecture expects: `(None, 64, 64, 4)` - 4-channel input (gridsize=2 format)

## Configuration Inconsistency

Both models were supposedly trained using the same configuration file (`configs/comparison_config.yaml` with `gridsize: 2`), but their architectures reveal they were actually trained with different gridsize settings:

- **PINN model**: Trained with gridsize=1 (single diffraction patterns)
- **Baseline model**: Trained with gridsize=2 (neighbor-grouped patterns)

This suggests the models were trained at different times or with different configurations despite the shared config file.

## Debug Journey

### Phase 1: Initial Investigation
- **Initial theory**: TensorFlow checkpoint loading issues due to warning messages
- **Finding**: Warnings were non-fatal; models load successfully when tested independently

### Phase 2: Root Cause Discovery
- **Discovery**: Input shape mismatch between model expectations and data format
- **Evidence**: Manual testing revealed the architectural incompatibility
- **Impact**: Script would fail during model inference with shape mismatch errors

### Phase 3: Mixed Gridsize Solution
- **Implementation**: Added auto-detection of model input requirements
- **Feature**: Separate data container creation for each model's specific needs
- **Validation**: Added compatibility checking and clear error messages
- **Result**: Validation passes, but output generation still fails

### Phase 4: Gemini Analysis
Fresh perspective from Gemini AI identified the most likely root causes:

1. **Silent Data Loop Failure**: Main processing loop never executes due to empty data iterators
2. **Control Flow Bug**: Validation logic leads to silent exit without proper error handling
3. **I/O Failure**: File operations fail silently due to permissions or path issues

## Current Implementation Status

The comparison script now includes:
- ✅ Auto-detection of model gridsize requirements from architecture
- ✅ Mixed gridsize support with separate data containers
- ✅ Input validation and compatibility checking
- ✅ Clear error messages for incompatible models
- ❌ **Missing**: Actual output file generation

## Execution Flow

```
1. Load test data ✅
2. Load both models ✅
3. Detect gridsize requirements ✅
4. Create appropriate data containers ✅
5. Validate compatibility ✅
6. Run PINN inference → [UNKNOWN STATUS]
7. Run Baseline inference → [UNKNOWN STATUS]
8. Generate comparison metrics → [FAILS SILENTLY]
9. Save output files → [FAILS SILENTLY]
```

## Gemini's Diagnostic Recommendations

### Most Likely Causes (Ranked by Probability)

1. **Silent Data Loop Failure**: Data iterator is empty, causing processing loops to be skipped
2. **Incorrect Control Flow**: Post-validation code path leads to silent exit
3. **Configuration Truth**: Models genuinely incompatible; script correctly detects this but handles it poorly

### Immediate Debug Steps

1. **Inspect Data Iterator**: Add debug prints to verify data container contains processable data
2. **Verify Training Configs**: Check actual configs saved during model training (not central config file)
3. **Trace I/O Paths**: Add debug prints before all file save operations
4. **Force Crash Test**: Remove validation to get verbose TensorFlow errors
5. **Minimal Reproduction**: Test each model independently with hardcoded data

## Files Modified

- `scripts/compare_models.py`: Added mixed gridsize support and validation
- `configs/comparison_config.yaml`: Modified during testing
- `debug.md`: Comprehensive investigation documentation

## Next Steps

1. Execute Gemini's diagnostic recommendations systematically
2. Add extensive debug logging to trace execution flow
3. Test minimal reproduction cases for each model independently
4. Determine if models require retraining with consistent configurations
5. Implement proper error handling for incompatible model scenarios

## Expected Resolution

Based on Gemini's analysis, the issue is likely either:
- **Data pipeline failure**: Empty iterators causing silent loop skipping
- **Valid incompatibility detection**: Script correctly identifies mismatched models but fails to handle this case properly

The solution will either be fixing the data loading pipeline or implementing proper handling of genuinely incompatible model pairs.
