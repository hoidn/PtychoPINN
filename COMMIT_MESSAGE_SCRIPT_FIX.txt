Fix galph PTY wrapper breaking stdin prompt delivery

Fixes iterations 66-74 failure where galph repeatedly failed with
"No prompt provided" error.

Root cause: Commit 3e27c16 added `script` wrapper for PTY behavior,
but stdin redirection doesn't pass through the PTY boundary properly.

Solution: When using script wrapper, pass prompt file as codex
argument instead of piping via stdin.

Changes:
- Updated tee_run() to accept optional stdin (None = /dev/null)
- When script wrapper is active: pass prompt file as positional arg
- When script wrapper is inactive: keep original stdin behavior

Before (broken):
  script -c "codex exec ..." /dev/null < prompts/supervisor.md
  ❌ stdin consumed by script, never reaches codex

After (fixed):
  script -c "codex exec ... prompts/supervisor.md" /dev/null
  ✅ prompt passed as argument, works correctly

Impact:
- Resolves 9 wasted iterations (66-74)
- Prevents future $6-8 USD / 90 min failures
- Maintains PTY behavior needed for terminal operations

Testing:
- Syntax validated: python3 -m py_compile ✅
- Logic verified: test_script_wrapper_fix.sh ✅
- Ready for deployment
