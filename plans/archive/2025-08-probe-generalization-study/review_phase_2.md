## Comments

This is an exemplary implementation of the goals outlined for Phase 2. The changes directly address the requirements of the "Experimental Probe Integration" and set a solid foundation for the subsequent 2x2 study.

**Strengths:**

*   **Adherence to Plan:** The new script, `create_experimental_probe_input.py`, perfectly aligns with the tasks detailed in `phase_2_checklist.md`. It successfully extracts the experimental probe, generates a compatible synthetic object using the established project logic, and saves the output in the correct format for the simulation pipeline.
*   **Code Quality & Robustness:** The script is well-structured, with clear functions, comprehensive docstrings, and excellent error handling. Input validation (file existence, probe shape, data types, NaN/inf checks) is thorough and will prevent issues in downstream tasks.
*   **Documentation & Usability:** The script includes a clear CLI with helpful usage examples. The code is self-documenting, and the addition of the `probe_comparison.png` visualization is a valuable asset for analysis and understanding the core of this study.
*   **Integration:** The developer has clearly considered the end-to-end workflow, ensuring the output `simulation_input_experimental_probe.npz` is immediately usable by `simulate_and_save.py`. This foresight is crucial for the success of the next phase.

The work is of high quality and meets all project standards.
