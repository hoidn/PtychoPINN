## Comments

The submitted code for Phase 1 is exemplary. It perfectly aligns with all requirements outlined in the R&D plan, implementation plan, and the detailed phase checklist.

- **Completeness:** All specified tasks, from directory creation to the implementation of the data contract, have been successfully completed.
- **Code Quality:** The new script, `run_tike_reconstruction.py`, is well-structured, clearly documented with comprehensive docstrings, and adheres to project standards by integrating with the existing logging and CLI argument modules.
- **Correctness:** The implementation correctly follows the Tike API, handles potential data loading issues gracefully, and produces artifacts that precisely match the specified data contract, including the complex metadata structure.
- **Documentation:** The accompanying `README.md` is clear, concise, and provides excellent guidance for using the new script and for future development in that directory.

The work is of high quality and provides a solid foundation for the subsequent phases of the initiative.
