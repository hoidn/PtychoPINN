## Comments

The submitted changes perfectly align with the objectives and tasks outlined in the R&D and implementation plans for Phase 2. The modifications to `scripts/compare_models.py` successfully introduce the three-way comparison capability, including the crucial data registration step for the Tike model to ensure a fair evaluation.

The implementation correctly handles the optional Tike input, ensuring full backward compatibility as required. The updates to plotting and metrics reporting (CSV) to include computation times fulfill all specified deliverables for this phase. The work is well-executed and directly addresses all items in the `phase_2_checklist.md`.
