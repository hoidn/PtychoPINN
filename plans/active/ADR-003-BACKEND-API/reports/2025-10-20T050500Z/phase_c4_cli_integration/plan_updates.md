## Plan Updates — 2025-10-20T050500Z

- C4.C6 and C4.C7 marked `[x]` after inference CLI switched to `load_inference_bundle_torch()`; summary + CLI logs archived in this directory.
- C4.D1 and C4.D2 now `[x]` with GREEN selectors; C4.D3 remains `[P]` pending dataloader coords_relative fix logged in `pytest_full_suite_c4.log`.
- Input for next engineer loop must prioritize resolving the integration failure before closing C4.D3 and progressing to C4.E documentation tasks.
