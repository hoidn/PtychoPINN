### Turn Summary
Scoped check_inbox_for_ack.py so Ralph can automate Maintainer response detection and tied it to a fresh artifact bucket plus loader guard instructions.
Confirmed via retrospective that the 2026-01-23T011900Z Do Now landed (follow-up note, fix_plan entry, pytest log) and that no acknowledgement exists yet, so the plan stays open.
Next: Ralph implements the inbox-scan CLI, records the JSON/MD summaries, updates docs/fix_plan.md based on the result, and reruns the generic_loader pytest.
