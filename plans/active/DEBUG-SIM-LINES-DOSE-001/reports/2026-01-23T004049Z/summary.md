### Turn Summary
Refocused DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001 on the D1 maintainer response and documented the outstanding checklist entry in docs/fix_plan.md.
Outlined the maintainer handoff deliverable plus verification/test steps inside input.md so Ralph can write inbox/response_dose_experiments_ground_truth.md and rerun the loader pytest.
Next: Ralph executes the Do Now, captures pytest + sha256 artifacts, and ships the maintainer note before we close the initiative.
