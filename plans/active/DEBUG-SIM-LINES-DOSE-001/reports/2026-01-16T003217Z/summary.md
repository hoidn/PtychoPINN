### Turn Summary
Analyzed the SIM-LINES-4X snapshot JSON vs legacy dose_experiments defaults to identify divergent parameters (photons, gridsize, grouping) and mapped them into a comparison draft for Phase A4.
Recorded diffs in the plan, updated the compliance checklist, and confirmed existing artifacts cover A1/A3; still need actionable code tasks for the comparison CLI.
Next: prepare a Do Now for Phase A4 with implementable instructions (comparison helper + logging) or pivot if dependencies block.
Artifacts: plans/active/DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001/reports/2026-01-16T003217Z/ (comparison_draft.md placeholder)
