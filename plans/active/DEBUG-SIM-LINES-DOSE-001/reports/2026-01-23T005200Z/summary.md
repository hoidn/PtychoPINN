### Turn Summary
Added E1 scope to the dose_experiments fix plan and set up the rehydration verification deliverable that proves the tarball decompresses and matches the manifest.
Authored verify_bundle_rehydration.py requirements, rerun/test expectations, and a maintainer-response addendum so Ralph can implement the script, log evidence, and rerun the loader test under 2026-01-23T005200Z.
Next: Ralph builds the verifier, captures rehydration_diff + pytest logs in the new report directory, and updates the inbox note before we close the initiative.
