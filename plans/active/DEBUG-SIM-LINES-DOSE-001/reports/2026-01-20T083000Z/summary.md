### Turn Summary
Mapped the next Phase C3b increment to extend the Phase C2 runner with ground-truth comparison artifacts so gs1_ideal vs gs2_ideal can be quantified instead of relying on screenshots.
Scoped the code touch to plan-local runner helpers (ground-truth dumps, center-crop diff metrics, metadata updates) plus reassembly/test reruns, updated the implementation plan/fix ledger, and rewrote input.md pointing Ralph at the new artifacts hub.
Next: Ralph updates the runner, reruns gs1_ideal and gs2_ideal with the new comparison outputs, refreshes reassembly telemetry, and archives the pytest evidence.
Artifacts: plans/active/DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001/reports/2026-01-20T083000Z/ (planning notes placeholder)
