### Turn Summary
Completed Phase D0 by creating `plan/parity_logging_spec.md` v1.0 with full JSON schema for pipeline telemetry, explicit probe logging block, maintainer coordination protocol, and two-track comparison plan for non-exact dataset parity.
Updated implementation.md D0 checklist to COMPLETE and wrote corrected input.md for D6 investigation (training label stats capture without loss-weight changes per CLAUDE.md constraint).
Next: Ralph implements D6 training label stats capture to identify label vs ground-truth scaling discrepancy.
Artifacts: plans/active/DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001/reports/2026-01-21T180000Z/ (parity_logging_spec.md in plan/)
