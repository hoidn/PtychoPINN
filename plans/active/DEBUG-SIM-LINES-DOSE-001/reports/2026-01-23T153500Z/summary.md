### Turn Summary
Scoped maintainer-status automation so we stop editing the inbox response/follow-ups by hand and captured it in docs/fix_plan.md.
Recorded the new Do Now with the update_maintainer_status.py CLI instructions, pytest selectors, and 2026-01-23T153500Z artifact scaffolding so Ralph can ship the helper plus fresh inbox evidence.
Next: Ralph implements the script/tests, runs the inbox CLI, and lets the new tool append the response block + follow-up note automatically.
