### Turn Summary
Implemented `update_maintainer_status.py` CLI that automates appending status blocks to response documents and generating follow-up notes from inbox scan results.
Created 4 comprehensive tests covering output generation and error handling; all tests pass along with existing inbox CLI suite (22 tests) and generic loader test.
Next: continue running inbox CLI on cadence until Maintainer <2> acknowledges.
