### Turn Summary
Documented the per-actor severity history gap and refreshed docs/fix_plan plus input.md so Ralph can persist ack_actor_summary data inside the history logs.
Staged the 2026-01-23T083500Z artifacts root and outlined code/test/doc steps (new history regression, CLI rerun, maintainer follow-up) that keep the SLA evidence chain verifiable.
Next: Ralph implements the history logging changes, runs the new pytest selector and loader guard, then captures the refreshed inbox scan outputs into the staged reports directory.
