### Turn Summary
Scoped the missing ack-actor follow-up persistence in the history JSONL/Markdown/dashboard and set up 2026-01-23T143500Z as the next artifact root.
Updated docs/fix_plan.md and galph_memory/input so Ralph has concrete instructions to extend check_inbox_for_ack.py, add the history regression test, and refresh the maintainer evidence bundle.
Next: Ralph implements the persistence/test/doc changes, reruns the CLI/tests per input.md, and records the new maintainer response once artifacts land.
