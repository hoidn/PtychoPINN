### Turn Summary
Implemented per-actor follow-up persistence so history files (JSONL/Markdown/Dashboard) capture outbound activity metrics for each monitored actor.
Added `ack_actor_followups` to JSONL, "Ack Actor Follow-Ups" column to Markdown history, and "Ack Actor Follow-Up Trends" section to the dashboard.
Next: Update the maintainer follow-up note and wait for Maintainer <2> acknowledgement.
