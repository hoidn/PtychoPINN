### Turn Summary
Refreshed the Phase D0 parity logging spec (v1.1) with explicit probe telemetry requirements plus maintainer coordination and dataset parity enforcement guidance.
Updated the implementation plan, fix plan, and galph memory to record the D0 completion and tie the maintainer request back to the new spec.
Rewrote input.md to hand Ralph the D6 training-label telemetry task with a fresh artifacts hub and concrete command map.
