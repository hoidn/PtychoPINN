### Turn Summary
Scoped SLA deadline/severity instrumentation for the inbox watcher and planned the Maintainer <3> escalation evidence drop.
Captured the git pull blockage caused by the user's dirty tree, reviewed fix_plan/docs, and rewrote input.md with concrete code/test/doc steps plus the new artifacts path.
Next: Ralph implements the SLA severity fields, runs the new pytest + CLI command, and updates the maintainer status/follow-up docs.
