### Turn Summary
Framed the maintainer-follow-up scope so DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001 now treats the delivery as technically complete and only an acknowledgement remains.
Reviewed the rehydration outputs plus the previous input brief, confirmed Ralph shipped the script/tests, and rewrote input.md with the fix-plan update + loader guard rerun instructions.
Next: Ralph sends the follow-up note, updates docs/fix_plan.md with the new F1 checklist entry, and reruns pytest tests/test_generic_loader.py::test_generic_loader -q while archiving logs under 2026-01-23T011900Z.
