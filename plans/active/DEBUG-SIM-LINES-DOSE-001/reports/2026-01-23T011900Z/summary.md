### Turn Summary
Sent follow-up note to Maintainer <2> summarizing the delivered dose_experiments bundle with tarball SHA and verification evidence; no code changes this loop.
Updated docs/fix_plan.md with the F1 checklist row (awaiting acknowledgement) and Attempts History entry documenting this follow-up.
Next: await Maintainer <2> acknowledgement to mark DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001 complete.

### Turn Summary (prior: supervisor)
Framed the maintainer-follow-up scope so DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001 now treats the delivery as technically complete and only an acknowledgement remains.
Reviewed the rehydration outputs plus the previous input brief, confirmed Ralph shipped the script/tests, and rewrote input.md with the fix-plan update + loader guard rerun instructions.
Next: Ralph sends the follow-up note, updates docs/fix_plan.md with the new F1 checklist entry, and reruns pytest tests/test_generic_loader.py::test_generic_loader -q while archiving logs under 2026-01-23T011900Z.
