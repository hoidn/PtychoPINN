### Turn Summary
Laid out the next DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001.F1 increment around persistent history logging for the inbox acknowledgement CLI.
Specified the CLI/test/doc work plus the 2026-01-23T014011Z artifacts path so Ralph can capture SLA evidence without touching production modules.
Next: Ralph extends check_inbox_for_ack.py with history outputs, runs the targeted pytest selectors, and updates docs/fix_plan/inbox with the new SLA data.
Artifacts: plans/active/DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001/reports/2026-01-23T014011Z/
