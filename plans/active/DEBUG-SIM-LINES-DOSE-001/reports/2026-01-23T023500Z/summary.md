### Turn Summary
Scoped the history-dashboard deliverable for the inbox acknowledgement CLI and logged the new checklist in docs/fix_plan.md so the focus stays aligned with the maintainer request.
Rewrote input.md with the CLI/test/doc/follow-up instructions plus the 2026-01-23T023500Z artifacts root, and captured the state change in galph_memory.
Next: Ralph implements the dashboard flag + tests, reruns the CLI with --history-dashboard, updates docs/fix_plan + inbox/response, and ships the SLA-backed follow-up note.
