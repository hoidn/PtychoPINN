### Turn Summary
Scoped per-actor severity trends for the inbox history dashboard and updated fix_plan/input so the next loop adds that capability plus regression coverage.
Captured the outstanding CLI/test/doc work for Ralph (new write_history_dashboard logic, new pytest, doc updates, Maintainer status/follow-up) and staged plans/active/DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001/reports/2026-01-23T093500Z/.
Next: Ralph implements the dashboard aggregation, runs the mapped pytest selectors + CLI capture, and refreshes docs/inbox artifacts.
