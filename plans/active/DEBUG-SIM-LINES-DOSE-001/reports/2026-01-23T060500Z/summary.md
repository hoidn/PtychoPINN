### Turn Summary
Scoped per-actor SLA override support for the inbox acknowledgement CLI plus the matching regression/documentation work so we can show Maintainer <2> vs <3> thresholds diverging.
Captured a refreshed fix_plan.md entry and input.md instructions for Ralph to add the new `--ack-actor-sla` flag, ship `test_ack_actor_sla_overrides_thresholds`, run the CLI into 2026-01-23T060500Z, and update docs/inbox evidence.
Next: Ralph implements the overrides, runs the mapped pytest selectors, executes the CLI capture, and updates the maintainer response/follow-up with the new per-actor threshold data.
