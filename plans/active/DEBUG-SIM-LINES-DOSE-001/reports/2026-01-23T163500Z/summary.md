### Turn Summary
Scoped run_inbox_cadence orchestration CLI + regression tests so maintainer follow-ups become a single reproducible command and recorded the plan gap.
Updated docs/fix_plan.md with the cadence entry and rewrote input.md with detailed CLI/test/doc instructions and artifact guardrails; git pull --rebase still blocked by the user's dirty worktree.
Next: Ralph implements run_inbox_cadence.py + tests, runs the automation to capture 2026-01-23T163500Z evidence, updates docs, and reruns the inbox + loader pytest guards.
Artifacts: plans/active/DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001/reports/2026-01-23T163500Z/ (input.md, planning notes)
