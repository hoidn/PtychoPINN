### Turn Summary
Framed the next D2 increment so the analyzer will compute normalization-invariant diagnostics tied directly to `specs/spec-ptycho-core.md §Normalization Invariants`, with refreshed evidence landing under the 2026-01-20T122937Z hub.
Recorded the plan updates in docs/fix_plan.md + the initiative summary and logged the ready-for-implementation handoff in galph_memory/input so Ralph knows exactly which files and commands to touch.
Next: Ralph extends `analyze_intensity_bias.py`, reruns it for `gs1_ideal` and `dose_legacy_gs2`, and keeps the synthetic-helpers CLI smoke selector green.
