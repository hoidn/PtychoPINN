### Turn Summary
Re-validated DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001.F1 requirements and confirmed inbox still lacks Maintainer <2> acknowledgement.
Documented the git pull --rebase block from the user's dirty worktree and reviewed check_inbox_for_ack.py plus fix_plan TODO context.
Authored a fresh input.md with explicit CLI/test steps, doc updates, and pitfalls so Ralph can refresh the inbox scan and loader guard using the 2026-01-23T013500Z artifacts path.
Next: Ralph executes the Do Now to rerun the scan, update docs/fix_plan + maintainer response, and capture pytest output.
