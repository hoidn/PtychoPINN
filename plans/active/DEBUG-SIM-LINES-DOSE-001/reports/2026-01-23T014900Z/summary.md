### Turn Summary
Scoped the next F1 loop so Ralph will extend the inbox scan CLI with direction-aware timeline metrics and rerun the loader pytest under a new evidence drop.
Documented the waiting-clock requirements plus docs/fix_plan and maintainer-response updates so we can quantify how long Maintainer <2> has been silent.
Next: Ralph updates check_inbox_for_ack.py, re-runs the CLI + pytest, and records the new timeline artifacts at 2026-01-23T014900Z.
Artifacts: plans/active/DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001/reports/2026-01-23T014900Z/ (input.md)
