### Turn Summary
Shifted the fix plan focus from seed to DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001 and documented the maintainer’s ground-truth bundle ask across fix_plan + galph memory.
Authored the new implementation plan plus Phase A1 manifest scope and rewrote input.md so Ralph builds make_ground_truth_manifest.py and verifies the datasets with pytest.
Next: Ralph implements the manifest CLI, runs the loader smoke test, and archives outputs in the 2026-01-23T001018Z report dir.
Artifacts: plans/active/DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001/reports/2026-01-23T001018Z/ (implementation.md, input.md)
