### Turn Summary
Scoped the ack_actor_summary instrumentation for check_inbox_for_ack.py so SLA breaches per actor can be surfaced alongside the existing tables.
Verified Maintainer <2> still shows no acknowledgement and extended docs/fix_plan/inbox plans with the 2026-01-23T070500Z evidence bundle plus the new regression/doc/test instructions.
Next: Ralph implements the summary + test, runs the targeted pytest selectors, executes the CLI capture, and refreshes the maintainer response/follow-up with the new data.
