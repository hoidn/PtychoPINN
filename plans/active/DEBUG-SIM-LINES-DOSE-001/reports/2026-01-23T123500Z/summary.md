### Turn Summary
Scoped Maintainer <3> escalation brief work for F1 (new CLI flags/helper, regression test, docs, CLI/inbox updates) and recorded it in input.md.
Documented pytest + CLI command map plus artifact path 2026-01-23T123500Z; git pull --rebase remains blocked by the large dirty worktree but noted in galph_memory.
Next: Ralph implements the brief/tests, runs the CLI bundle, and refreshes docs/inbox/fix_plan per the plan.
