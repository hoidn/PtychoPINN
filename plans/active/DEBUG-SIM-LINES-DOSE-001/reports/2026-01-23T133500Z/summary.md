### Turn Summary
Scoped the Maintainer follow-up gap by reviewing the latest F1 evidence and updating docs/fix_plan so we target per-actor outbound metrics next.
Wrote a detailed Do Now (input.md) covering recipient parsing, follow-up tables, regression test, doc/test index updates, and the refreshed maintainer artifacts.
Staged the 2026-01-23T133500Z reports root so Ralph’s upcoming CLI + pytest runs have a home for logs and outputs.
