### Turn Summary
Scoped the per-actor SLA severity deliverable and refreshed docs/fix_plan/input so Ralph can extend check_inbox_for_ack.py plus its tests while staying aligned with the maintainer ask.
Recorded the git pull --rebase blockage (dirty user worktree) without touching their files and staged the 2026-01-23T050500Z artifacts root + Do Now instructions for the next CLI/test/doc loop.
Next: Ralph implements the CLI/test/docs updates, reruns the inbox scan with Maintainer <2>/<3>, and captures pytest logs plus the new follow-up note under the staged reports directory.
