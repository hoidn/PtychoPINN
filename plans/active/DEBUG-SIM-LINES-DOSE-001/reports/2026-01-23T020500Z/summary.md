### Turn Summary
Authored a new SLA-aware Do Now for the inbox scan CLI so Ralph can quantify Maintainer <2>'s silence and capture pytest-backed evidence.
Recorded the instructions plus artifacts path inside input.md and logged the refreshed focus entry in galph_memory.md; git pull --rebase still blocked by the user's dirty worktree (left untouched).
Next: Ralph implements the CLI + pytest + doc updates, runs the new selector and loader guard, and publishes the SLA-aware inbox report.
