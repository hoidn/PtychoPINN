### Turn Summary
Scoped the next DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001.F1 increment around multi-actor acknowledgement detection plus --keywords fix, updated docs/fix_plan, and rewrote input.md for Ralph.
Primary gap remains Maintainer <2> silence; the new instructions have Ralph extending check_inbox_for_ack.py with --ack-actor/keyword changes, shipping tests/docs, and rerunning the CLI with Maintainer <3> coverage.
Next: Ralph implements the CLI/test/doc updates, runs pytest + the SLA CLI, and drafts the 2026-01-23T024800Z follow-up with refreshed evidence.
