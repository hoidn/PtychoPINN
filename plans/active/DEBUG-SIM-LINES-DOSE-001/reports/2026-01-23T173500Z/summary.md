### Turn Summary
Re-planned DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001.F1 around running run_inbox_cadence.py at 2026-01-23T173500Z so the next maintainer evidence drop is scripted end-to-end.
Updated input.md with the cadence command, pytest guard, metadata inspection, and fix_plan/follow-up updates so Ralph can execute immediately.
Next: Ralph runs the cadence CLI + pytest, rolls the maintainer response/follow-up forward, and logs the attempt in docs/fix_plan.md.
Artifacts: plans/active/DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001/reports/2026-01-23T173500Z/ (input.md, plan notes)
