### Turn Summary
Scoped the status snippet + escalation note breach timeline work so Maintainers can read streak ages without opening the dashboard.
Updated docs/fix_plan.md and input.md with the 2026-01-23T113500Z plan covering code/test/doc steps plus the new CLI capture instructions.
Next: Ralph updates check_inbox_for_ack.py, extends the snippet/escalation tests, runs the mapped pytest selectors, and captures the inbox artifacts under this timestamp.
