### Turn Summary
Scoped Phase D2 around explicit normalization-ratio telemetry and dose-like replay evidence, updating the plan checklist plus fix_plan attempts history accordingly.
Drafted the new Do Now (input.md) so Ralph adds ratio logging to the runner/analyzer, reruns gs1_ideal and a dose-style override, and archives everything under the fresh 2026-01-20T114126Z hub with the pytest guard.
Next: implement the instrumentation, run both scenarios, generate the analyzer report, and keep the CLI smoke test green.
