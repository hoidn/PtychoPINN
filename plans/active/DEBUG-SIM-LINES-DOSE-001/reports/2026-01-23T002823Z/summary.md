### Turn Summary
Clarified Phase C scope for DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001 and refreshed the implementation/fix plans so the maintainer bundle drop is unblocked.
Captured all packaging CLI + README delivery requirements (copy layout, verification logs, tarball metadata, pytest guard) and documented the manifest/pinn_run path bug that must be fixed in generate_legacy_readme.py.
Next: Ralph builds package_ground_truth_bundle.py, patches the README generator per spec, runs the packaging commands, and records pytest logs under 2026-01-23T002823Z.
