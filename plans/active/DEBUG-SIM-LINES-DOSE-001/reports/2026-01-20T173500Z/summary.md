### Turn Summary
Instrumented the next Phase D4 increment: plan-local runner/analyzer now need IntensityScaler + training-container telemetry before we touch production physics.
Captured concrete edits plus gs2 baseline/60-epoch reruns and guard selectors inside `input.md` so Ralph can execute code/tests directly under the new hub.
Next: Ralph implements the instrumentation, reruns both scenarios, regenerates the analyzer, and archives the CLI smoke selector in the hub.
