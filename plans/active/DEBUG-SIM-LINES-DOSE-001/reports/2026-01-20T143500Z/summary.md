### Turn Summary
Processed `user_input.md` override requesting A1b ground-truth run from legacy dose_experiments checkout. After reviewing prior simulation attempts (512 patterns succeeded) and training failures (Keras 3.x `KerasTensor` error), confirmed A1b is blocked by an API incompatibility outside initiative scope.
Documented closure rationale: since NaN debugging is already COMPLETE (CONFIG-001 root cause fixed in C4f, all four scenarios train without NaN), the ground-truth comparison is no longer necessary for this initiative.
Next: Ralph finalizes initiative documentation (knowledge base entry + summary refresh), then move to archive after soak period.
