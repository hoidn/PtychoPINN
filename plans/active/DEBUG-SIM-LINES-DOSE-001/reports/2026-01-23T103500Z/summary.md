### Turn Summary
Scoped the per-actor breach timeline deliverable and refreshed docs/fix_plan.md plus galph instructions so the next loop targets the new history-dashboard table/test/doc bundle.
Validated the maintainer evidence gap (Maintainer <2> still silent) and rewrote input.md with concrete code/test/CLI/doc steps that land artifacts under 2026-01-23T103500Z.
Next: Ralph implements the breach-timeline helper + pytest selector, runs the mapped tests, executes the inbox CLI capture, and updates docs/inbox per the refreshed plan.
Artifacts: plans/active/DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001/reports/2026-01-23T103500Z/ (input.md, fix_plan.md update)
