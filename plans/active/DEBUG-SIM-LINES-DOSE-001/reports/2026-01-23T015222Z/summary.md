### Turn Summary
Scoped the next DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001.F1 loop around a new --status-snippet output for the inbox ACK CLI and rewrote input.md with concrete code/test/doc tasks plus the 2026-01-23T015222Z artifact root.
Revalidated docs/fix_plan.md + inbox maintainer status (still no ack) and mapped the exact CLI/pytest/doc-sync steps Ralph must follow, including the new pytest selector + log collection.
Git pull --rebase is still blocked by the user's dirty worktree, so I left their files untouched.
Next: Ralph implements the status-snippet helper/test, reruns the CLI into 2026-01-23T015222Z, updates docs/fix_plan.md + the maintainer response with the new snippet snapshots, and records the mapped pytest logs.
