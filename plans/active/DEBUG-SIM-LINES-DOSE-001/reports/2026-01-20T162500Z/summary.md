### Turn Summary
Documented the gs2_ideal 60-epoch retrain outcome (H-NEPOCHS rejected), updated docs/fix_plan/summary with the new evidence, and re-established Phase D4 as the active focus.
Aligned the ORCH-ORCHESTRATOR plan status with fix_plan (Phase E complete) and added the H-NEPOCHS-001 finding so reviewer cadence instructions stay trustworthy.
Next: extend `plans/active/DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001/bin/analyze_intensity_bias.py` with loss-composition + stage-ratio reporting, rerun it for gs2 baseline vs 60-epoch runs, and keep the CLI smoke guard green.
