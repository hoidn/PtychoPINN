### Turn Summary
Marked Phase A (manifest + pytest) as complete in the implementation plan and added explicit Phase B/C TODO rows in docs/fix_plan.md so the maintainer bundle scope is visible.
Authored a new DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001.B1 Do Now that has Ralph build generate_legacy_readme.py, reuse the manifest/baseline summary, and run pytest test_generic_loader to validate the datasets referenced by the README.
Next: Ralph implements the README generator CLI, captures README/log artifacts under 2026-01-23T001931Z, and we can then expand provenance (B2) before copying data (Phase C).
Artifacts: plans/active/DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001/reports/2026-01-23T001931Z/ (summary.md)
