### Turn Summary
Documented the landed D4d lazy-container reducer, updated the plan/fix ledger, and recorded the existing pytest logs so the prior evidence stays traceable.
Scoped Phase D4e to swap the loader’s closed-form normalization for the dataset-derived scale, opened hub 2026-01-21T005723Z, and rewrote input.md with the concrete code/test/analyzer commands.
Next: Ralph updates normalize_data(), lands the new loader normalization tests, reruns gs2_ideal plus the analyzer, and keeps the CLI smoke selector green.
