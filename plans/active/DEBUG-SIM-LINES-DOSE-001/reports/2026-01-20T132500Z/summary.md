### Turn Summary
Deduped the duplicated 2026-01-20T121500Z attempts entry in docs/fix_plan.md and recorded the doc hygiene request along with a new plan note.
Opened the 2026-01-20T132500Z hub plus plan/summary updates so the ratio-diagnostics increment has a landing zone and traceable record.
Next: implement the analyzer stage-ratio extension, rerun it for gs1_ideal + gs2_ideal, and capture the CLI pytest guard.
