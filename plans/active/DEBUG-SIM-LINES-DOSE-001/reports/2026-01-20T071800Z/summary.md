### Turn Summary
Scoped Phase C3 to add per-epoch telemetry to the Phase C2 runner so gs1_ideal vs gs2_ideal NaNs can be diagnosed without touching production modules.
Marked C2b complete, updated the implementation plan + fix plan attempts, and refreshed input.md with the new instrumentation Do Now plus pytest/reassembly commands.
Next: implement the runner instrumentation, rerun both scenarios under the new hub, and capture history.json/history_summary plus the reassembly + pytest evidence.
