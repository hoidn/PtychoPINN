### Turn Summary — 2026-01-20T11:02:27Z (Phase D1 scope)
Reopened the initiative under Phase D, added the new checklist to the implementation plan, and documented the course-correction entry in docs/fix_plan.md so amplitude bias investigation is the active focus again.
Scoped D1 around a loss-weight comparison, created artifacts hub `plans/active/DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001/reports/2026-01-20T110227Z/`, and rewrote input.md instructing Ralph to extend the plan-local parameter diff CLI, capture MAE/NLL/realspace weights, and rerun the CLI smoke pytest guard.
Next: Ralph implements the D1 CLI extension, generates the loss-config Markdown/JSON diff, and archives the pytest log under the new hub.
