### Turn Summary
Inserted Phase C4 intensity-normalization work into the plan and logged it in docs/fix_plan.md so the initiative now targets telemetry rather than scaler weights.
Authored input.md with implementation + rerun instructions for adding the stats helper and rerunning gs1/gs2 under the 2026-01-20T113000Z hub.
Next: Ralph instruments run_phase_c2_scenario.py, reruns both scenarios, and archives the pytest log plus intensity stats in the new hub.
