# DEBUG-SIM-LINES-DOSE-001 Summary

2026-01-13: Drafted the phased debugging plan to isolate sim_lines_4x vs dose_experiments discrepancies.
2026-01-16: Captured the SIM-LINES-4X parameter snapshot (new CLI) plus the legacy `dose_experiments` tree/script for comparison and reran the synthetic helpers CLI smoke test to prove the pipeline import path is healthy.
