### Turn Summary
Limited compare_models smoke succeeds past Translation but still fails with `ValueError: Layer "functional_10" expects 2 input(s), but it received 1 input` (`plans/active/STUDY-SYNTH-FLY64-DOSE-OVERLAP-001/reports/2025-11-12T010500Z/phase_g_dense_full_run_verifier/cli/compare_models_smoke_test/logs/logs/debug.log:370-402`), so `{analysis}/verification_report.json` remains 0/10 with no SSIM/verification/highlights/metrics/preview bundle.
Plan, ledger, hub summary, and input now require wiring the grouped offsets + perfect-square guard into `scripts/compare_models.py`, adding regression tests in `tests/study/test_dose_overlap_comparison.py`, rerunning the limited smoke to capture a GREEN log, and only then repeating the guarded pytest selectors + counted Phase G pipeline + metrics/report helpers until the verification bundle exists (failures → `$HUB/red/blocked_<timestamp>.md`).
Next: implement the baseline wiring/tests, capture the limited smoke log without the ValueError, re-run the Phase D guards, then execute the clobbered dense pipeline + post-verify helper + metrics refresh so `{analysis}` finally reports 10/10 validity and publishes the SSIM/verification/highlights/metrics/preview/artifact-inventory bundle.

### Turn Summary
Translation crash persists: `$HUB/analysis/dose_1000/dense/train/comparison.log` still throws `ValueError: Dimensions must be equal, but are 128 and 32`, so `analysis/verification_report.json` remains 0/10 and no SSIM/verification/highlights/metrics/preview/inventory artifacts exist yet.
Plan/ledger/input now require patching `scripts/compare_models.py` to force/log `params.cfg['gridsize']=sqrt(channel_count)` (plus a limited `scripts/compare_models.py` smoke log) before rerunning the guarded pytest selectors, `run_phase_g_dense.py --clobber`, the fully parameterized `--post-verify-only` helper, metrics helpers, and evidence refresh.
Next: land the compare_models gridsize fix + smoke log, then rerun the Phase G pipeline until `{analysis}` contains the SSIM grid / verification / highlights / metrics / preview / artifact inventory bundle and `analysis/verification_report.json` reads 10/10 (failures → `$HUB/red/blocked_<timestamp>.md`).

### Turn Summary
Implemented the geometry-acceptance floor mandated by ACCEPTANCE-001: `studies/fly64_dose_overlap/overlap.py` now records `geometry_acceptance_bound`/`effective_min_acceptance` in both the metrics JSON and NPZ `_metadata`, the Phase D spec documents the new fields, and `tests/study/test_dose_overlap_overlap.py` gained a dense acceptance-floor regression (captured under `$HUB/green/pytest_dense_acceptance_floor.log` alongside the scalar-metadata selector). Added `DiffractionToObjectAdapter` to `load_inference_bundle` so grouped inference bundles resync `params.cfg['gridsize']` before hitting Translation, preventing the B vs B·C crash. Attempted to rerun `python -m studies.fly64_dose_overlap.comparison --phase-c-root "$HUB/data/phase_c" --phase-e-root "$HUB/data/phase_e" --phase-f-root "$HUB/data/phase_f" --artifact-root "$HUB/analysis" --dose 100000 --view dense --split train`, but the manifest still reports zero jobs because the counted gs2 Phase E artifacts were never generated; the new log lives at `$HUB/cli/phase_g_dense_train.log`. Phase G execution remains blocked on regenerating Phase D/Phase E outputs plus the SSIM/verification/highlights/metrics/preview/artifact-inventory bundle spelled out in the plan.

### Turn Summary
Re-audited the Phase G hub and verification preflight still reports 0/10 valid checks—no SSIM grid, verification logs, highlights, metrics summary/delta/digest, or preview/artifact inventory have been produced since the 2025-11-12 runs.
`cli/phase_d_dense.log` is still empty and `cli/phase_e_dense_gs2_dose1000.log` ends with “No jobs match the specified filters,” so dose=1000 dense NPZ/weight artifacts never materialized and the only comparison manifest/logs still target the older dose=100000 job that fails in `Translation.call`.
Refreshed the plan + ledger so the Do Now again mandates guarded pytest selectors followed by the counted dense pipeline with `--clobber`, the fully parameterized `--post-verify-only` helper, metrics/reporting helpers, and explicit verification that Phase D/Phase E outputs exist (otherwise capture blockers under `$HUB/red/`).
Next: run the two overlap tests, execute the counted dense pipeline + helper from `/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN`, rerun the metrics helpers so `{analysis}` gains the SSIM/verification/highlights/metrics/preview/inventory bundle, and update docs once `verification_report.json` flips to 10/10.

### Turn Summary
Re-audited the Phase G hub and confirmed `analysis/verification_report.json` still reports 0/10 checks with no SSIM/verification/highlights/metrics/preview bundle in place.
`cli/run_phase_g_dense_stdout.log`, `cli/phase_d_dense.log`, and `cli/phase_e_dense_gs2_dose1000.log` are all dated 2025-11-12—the Phase D log is empty and dense training still logs “No jobs match the specified filters,” so there is no `data/phase_e/dose_1000/dense/gs2/wts.h5.zip`.
Captured the lingering comparison failure (`analysis/dose_100000/dense/train/comparison.log` still raises `ValueError: Dimensions must be equal, but are 128 and 32`) and refreshed the plan so the Do Now now mandates verifying Phase D/Phase E artifacts immediately after rerunning `run_phase_g_dense.py --clobber` plus the post-verify helper.
Next: rerun the two overlap pytest selectors, execute the counted dense pipeline and fully parameterized `--post-verify-only` sweep from `/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN`, then regenerate the metrics/digest/preview/inventory bundle (blockers → `$HUB/red/blocked_<timestamp>.md`).

### Turn Summary
Reopened the Phase G dense rerun effort after verifying `analysis/verification_report.json` still reports 0/10 required artifacts (no SSIM/verification/highlights/metrics/preview evidence in the hub).
Captured a new `<plan_update>` + Do Now that spells out the guarded pytest selectors, counted dense pipeline, `--post-verify-only` helper, and metrics scripts, then refreshed docs/fix_plan.md, the hub summary, and input.md so Ralph executes the commands from `/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN`.
Next: run the two overlap tests, execute the counted dense pipeline and post-verify helper with the HUB exports, rerun the metrics helpers, and publish the SSIM grid / verification / highlights / metrics / preview bundle (failures → `$HUB/red/` with command + exit code).

### Turn Summary
Re-audited the Phase G hub and verified `analysis/verification_report.json` still reports 0/10 with no SSIM/verification/highlights/metrics/preview/artifact-inventory evidence in `{analysis}`.
Captured the new failure signature (`ValueError: Dimensions must be equal, but are 128 and 32` in `analysis/dose_1000/dense/train/comparison.log` with `analysis/blocker.log` pointing at `cli/phase_g_dense_train.log`), proving the counted rerun still hasn’t executed since 2025-11-12.
Updated the implementation plan, docs/fix_plan.md, hub summary, input.md, and galph_memory so Ralph reruns the guarded pytest selectors, the clobbered `run_phase_g_dense.py` + fully parameterized `--post-verify-only`, the metrics/report scripts, and now inspects `comparison.log`/`phase_g_dense_train.log`, capturing `$HUB/red/blocked_<timestamp>.md` if the Translation error persists.
Next: guard `/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN`, rerun the two overlap pytest selectors, execute the counted pipeline and metrics helpers exactly as written, and publish the full Phase G evidence bundle once `verification_report.json` reaches 10/10 (or log the blocker immediately).
