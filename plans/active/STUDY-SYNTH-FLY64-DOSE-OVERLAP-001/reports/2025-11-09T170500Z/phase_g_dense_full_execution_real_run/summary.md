### Turn Summary
Logged the highlights automation success in docs/fix_plan.md and opened the 170500Z hub with fresh plan/input for the dense evidence run.
Flagged the remaining gap as executing run_phase_g_dense.py --clobber to harvest real MS-SSIM/MAE deltas, with guardrails captured in the How-To Map.
Next: Ralph should rerun the highlights regression selector, execute the dense pipeline, and propagate the resulting deltas into summary.md and the ledger.
