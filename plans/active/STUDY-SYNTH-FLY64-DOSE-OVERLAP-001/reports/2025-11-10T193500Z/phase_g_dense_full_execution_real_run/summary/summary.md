### Turn Summary
Prepared the 193500Z dense hub and refreshed plan/input to target highlight validator + preview alignment before rerunning the dense pipeline.
Verified prior hubs still lacked Phase D–G artifacts and documented gaps so the new Do Now centers on RED fixtures and JSON/preview parity.
Next: Ralph ships the enhanced tests/validator, runs the dense pipeline into 193500Z, and archives verifier/highlights evidence with ledger updates.
