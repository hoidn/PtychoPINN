### Turn Summary
Staged dense Phase G CLI evidence plan with a new collect-only smoke test and refreshed hub for log capture.
Revalidated prepare_hub coverage and updated docs/fix_plan.md plus input.md to point Ralph at CLI execution, validation, and doc-sync steps.
Next: Ralph ships the collect-only test, runs the dense pipeline with --clobber, and records metadata/metrics evidence per instructions.
