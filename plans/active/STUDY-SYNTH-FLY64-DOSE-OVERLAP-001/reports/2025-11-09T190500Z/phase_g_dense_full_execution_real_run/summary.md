### Turn Summary
Audited the 2025-11-09T170500Z dense pipeline hub and confirmed only Phase C outputs exist with no orchestrator processes running.
Staged the 2025-11-09T190500Z planning hub, updated docs/fix_plan.md, and rewrote input.md to hand off a clean pipeline rerun with explicit artifact checks.
Next: Ralph runs the dense Phase C→G pipeline in the new hub, verifies the full metrics bundle, and records MS-SSIM/MAE deltas in summary/docs.
