FIX-COMPARE-MODELS-TRANSLATION-001 RESOLVED
============================================

Issue: Dense Phase G compare_models failed with Translation ValueError (batch shape mismatch)
Root Causes:
  1. Batched reassembly shape mismatch (canvas vs batch_result dimensions)
  2. XLA vectorization batch dimension errors with >1000 patches

Fixes Applied:
  - Commit a80d4d2b: Fixed _reassemble_position_batched to use static padded_size in tf.image.resize_with_crop_or_pad
  - Commit bf3f1b07: Disabled vectorized path in mk_reassemble_position_real, forced streaming with tf.while_loop

Verification:
  - pytest tests GREEN (2/2 passed)
  - Train split compare_models: SUCCESS (exit 0)
  - Test split compare_models: SUCCESS (exit 0)
  - Fresh metrics generated for both splits

Status: UNBLOCKED - STUDY-SYNTH-FLY64-DOSE-OVERLAP-001 can proceed with counted Phase G rerun
