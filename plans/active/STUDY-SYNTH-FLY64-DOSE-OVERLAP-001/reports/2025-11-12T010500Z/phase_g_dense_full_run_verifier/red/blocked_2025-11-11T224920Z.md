# Blocker: Greedy Packing Inefficiency Below Geometry Bound

**Timestamp:** $(date -u +%FT%H%M%SZ)
**Phase:** D (Overlap View Generation)
**Status:** BLOCKED

## Problem

Dense view generation fails because greedy spacing selection achieves only 0.8% acceptance while the geometry-aware bound calculates 0.96% as theoretically possible.

## Evidence

From `cli/phase_d_dense.log`:
```
Geometry acceptance bound: 0.0096 (0.96%)
Effective minimum acceptance: 0.0096 (0.96%)
Greedy selection result:
  Accepted: 42/5088 (0.8%)
ValueError: both < minimum 1.0% (geometry acceptance bound: 1.0%)
```

## Root Cause

The geometry-aware bound computes theoretical maximum via circle packing (`area / (π * (threshold/2)²) / n_positions`), but the greedy algorithm (which iteratively selects positions with maximum minimum spacing) cannot achieve this theoretical maximum due to:
1. Irregular position distribution in the scan grid
2. Greedy algorithm's local optimization (not globally optimal packing)
3. Edge effects in the bounding box

## Attempted Fixes

1. **Epsilon reduction** (0.01 → 0.0005): Allowed geometry bound to work but didn't solve greedy < bound issue
2. **80% tolerance** (0.80 * geometry_bound): Pragmatic but breaks existing test expectations

## Options Forward

A. Accept 80% of geometry bound as threshold (practical greedy efficiency) → requires test update
B. Improve greedy algorithm (e.g., simulated annealing, optimal packing) → significant refactor
C. Relax dense view threshold (38.4 px → ~30 px) → changes study design
D. Accept smaller dataset (42 positions = 0.8%) as valid for dense view → document limitation

## Recommendation

Option A with clear documentation that greedy packing achieves 80-85% of theoretical bound in practice.

## Next Steps

- Decide on acceptance criterion philosophy
- Update test expectations if choosing Option A
- Document packing efficiency factor in findings.md
