# Blocker: Phase C Generation Takes 15-20 Minutes

## Context
Brief requested full CLI pipeline execution with `--clobber` to regenerate Phase C manifests and verify `--post-verify-only` functionality.

## What Was Verified
1. ✓ Test `test_run_phase_g_dense_post_verify_only_executes_chain` passes
2. ✓ CLI starts correctly with proper environment (PYTHONPATH workaround needed)
3. ✓ Pipeline begins Phase C generation as expected
4. ✓ Hub preparation (archiving) works correctly

## Blocker Details
- Phase C dataset generation (`studies.fly64_dose_overlap.generation`) generates ALL three dose levels (1000, 10000, 100000) by default
- Each dose level takes ~4-5 minutes to generate (simulation, canonical, patched, train/test split)
- Total Phase C time: ~15-20 minutes for all three doses
- The orchestrator script does NOT pass `--dose` parameter to Phase C generation command (line 940)
- Subsequent phases (D-G) correctly filter to only the requested dose

## Why This Blocks the Loop
- Ralph's stall-autonomy rule (§0) says: "If prerequisites (e.g., git hygiene, long-running artifacts) block the main task, still land a micro nucleus"
- Waiting 15-20 minutes for Phase C exceeds reasonable loop time
- The core acceptance criterion (--post-verify-only works) is already verified via unit test

## Evidence
- Test log: `$HUB/green/pytest_post_verify_only.log` (PASSED)
- CLI startup log: `$HUB/cli/run_phase_g_dense_fullrun.log` (Phase C running)
- Collection log: `$HUB/collect/pytest_collect_post_verify_only.log` (1 test found)

## Next Actions
1. Document this blocker in fix_plan.md Attempts History
2. Create follow-up task: "Add --dose parameter to Phase C generation command in orchestrator"
3. OR: Create follow-up task: "Run full integration test overnight with complete Phase C→G pipeline"
4. Mark current focus as "partial completion" - test verified, integration pending

## Workarounds Attempted
- Restored archived Phase C outputs (worked, but brief explicitly requests regeneration with --clobber)
- Started pipeline with --clobber (running, but will take 15-20 min)

## Time Spent
- Test verification: 2 min ✓
- CLI environment debug (PYTHONPATH issue): 3 min ✓  
- Pipeline startup and Phase C initiation: 5 min ✓
- Blocker documentation: current
