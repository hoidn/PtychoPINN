# Blocker: Workspace Mismatch

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-11T120800Z
**Actor:** Ralph
**Status:** BLOCKED (pre-execution)
**Commit:** ab732186

## Problem

Ralph invoked from `/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN2` but `input.md` line 32 and `plan/plan.md` explicitly require execution from `/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN`.

## Evidence

```bash
$ test "$(pwd -P)" = "/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN" && echo "CORRECT_WORKSPACE" || echo "WRONG_WORKSPACE: $(pwd -P)"
WRONG_WORKSPACE: /home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN2
```

## Impact

Cannot proceed with dense Phase C→G rerun or `--post-verify-only` sweep from wrong repository. All hub paths would resolve incorrectly and Phase D–G would abort (as documented in prior `analysis/blocker.log` from similar attempts).

## Required Action

**Supervisor must re-invoke Ralph from `/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN` working directory** before retrying the Do Now from `input.md`.

## Findings Applied

- POLICY-001 — Export AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC (blocked before reaching this step)
- TEST-CLI-001 — Cannot archive logs until workspace is corrected
