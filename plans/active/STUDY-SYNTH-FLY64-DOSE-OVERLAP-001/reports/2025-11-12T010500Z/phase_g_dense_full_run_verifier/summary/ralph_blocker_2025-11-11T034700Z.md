# Ralph Blocker Report — 2025-11-11T034700Z

## Blocker Classification
**Wrong repository context**

## Problem Statement
Ralph was invoked from `/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN2`, but `input.md` line 22 (How-To Map step 1) explicitly requires execution from the canonical `/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN` to ensure hub paths populate correctly.

## Impact
This violates the first listed pitfall in `input.md`:
> "Running commands from `/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN2` (the hub paths written there never populate this repo's evidence tree)."

Executing commands from the wrong repository would:
- Break POLICY-001 (AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC environment variable contract)
- Break TEST-CLI-001 (evidence archival contract — pytest/CLI logs would go to wrong hub)
- Populate evidence in the wrong directory tree
- Create confusion between two separate repository instances

## Actions Taken
1. Ran `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` — encountered unstaged changes
2. Stashed unstaged report artifacts:
   - `plans/active/STUDY-SYNTH-FLY64-DOSE-OVERLAP-001/reports/2025-11-12T010500Z/phase_g_dense_full_run_verifier/cli/phase_c_generation.log` (modified)
   - `plans/active/STUDY-SYNTH-FLY64-DOSE-OVERLAP-001/reports/2025-11-12T010500Z/phase_g_dense_full_run_verifier/cli/run_phase_g_dense_stdout.log` (modified)
   - `plans/active/STUDY-SYNTH-FLY64-DOSE-OVERLAP-001/reports/2025-11-12T010500Z/phase_g_dense_full_run_verifier/data/` (untracked)
3. Successfully pulled with rebase (already up to date)
4. Restored stashed changes
5. Verified repository path: `/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN2` (WRONG)
6. Required repository path: `/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN` (per input.md)
7. **STOPPED** — no work performed

## Resolution Options
Supervisor must choose one of the following:

### Option A: Change Working Directory (Recommended)
Invoke Ralph from `/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN` before running the next loop. This maintains the existing `input.md` contract and ensures hub paths are correct.

### Option B: Update input.md Context
If work must proceed from `/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN2`, update `input.md` to:
1. Acknowledge the PtychoPINN2 context
2. Adjust all hub paths accordingly
3. Update the "Pitfalls To Avoid" section
4. Ensure POLICY-001 and TEST-CLI-001 contracts remain satisfied with the new paths

## Findings Applied
- POLICY-001 — Would be violated if commands executed from wrong repo
- TEST-CLI-001 — Would be violated if pytest/CLI logs archived to wrong hub
- Input.md Pitfall #1 — Detected and prevented

## Status
**BLOCKED** — No code changes made. Awaiting supervisor directive.

## Artifacts
This blocker report only. No pytest logs, CLI runs, or code modifications performed.
