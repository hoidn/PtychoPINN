# Workspace Mismatch Blocker (2025-11-11T115954Z)

## Problem Statement
Ralph was invoked in `/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN2` but the task (`input.md` + `plan/plan.md`) explicitly requires execution from `/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN`.

## Evidence
- **Current working directory**: `/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN2`
- **Required working directory**: `/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN` (per `input.md` line 21, `plan/plan.md` line 16)
- **Prior failure root cause**: Previous attempts failed because Phase C generation ran from the wrong clone and wrote to incorrect output paths (`/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN2/data/phase_c`), causing Phase D–G to abort.

## Why This Blocks Execution
1. All hub paths in `input.md` are specified relative to `/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN`:
   - `$HUB=$PWD/plans/active/STUDY-SYNTH-FLY64-DOSE-OVERLAP-001/reports/2025-11-12T010500Z/phase_g_dense_full_run_verifier`
2. The Phase C generator would write to wrong output paths again
3. Phase D–G would fail to find Phase C outputs and abort (as documented in `analysis/blocker.log`)

## Required Action
**Supervisor must re-invoke Ralph from `/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN` working directory** before the Do Now can execute.

## Reference
- `input.md` line 21: `test "$(pwd -P)" = "/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN"`
- `plan/plan.md` line 16: "Confirm you are in `/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN`"
- Prior blocker: `analysis/blocker.log` shows Phase C failure from wrong repo

## Status
**BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed until workspace is corrected.
