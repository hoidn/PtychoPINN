### Turn Summary
Executed both pytest GREEN guards (test_filter_dataset_by_mask_handles_scalar_metadata PASSED 1.37s, test_generate_overlap_views_basic PASSED 1.48s as the dense acceptance floor test was not found).
Launched Phase C→G dense pipeline with --clobber flag; TensorFlow/CUDA initialized on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, currently running Phase C dataset generation (background shell 742681, estimated 30-120 minutes).
Next: await pipeline completion, execute --post-verify-only sweep, run metrics helpers, and publish SSIM grid/verification/highlights/metrics/preview bundle with MS-SSIM ±0.000 / MAE ±0.000000 deltas.
