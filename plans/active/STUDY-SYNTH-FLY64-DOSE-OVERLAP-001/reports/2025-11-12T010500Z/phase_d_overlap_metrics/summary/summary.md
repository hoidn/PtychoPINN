### Turn Summary
Confirmed Phase D still depends on dense/sparse spacing gates and the overlap CLI/tests lack Metric 1/2/3 coverage, so pivoted the focus to the new `phase_d_overlap_metrics` hub with a TDD-ready plan, reality check, and evidence expectations.
Updated `plans/active/STUDY-SYNTH-FLY64-DOSE-OVERLAP-001/implementation.md` (new plan_update + Do Now) and `docs/fix_plan.md` so overlap metrics are the sole Active Focus, complete with ready_for_implementation commands and guardrails before any Phase G rerun.
Next: Ralph must implement Metric 1/2/3 in `studies/fly64_dose_overlap/overlap.py`, refresh the CLI/tests, and capture the pytest + CLI logs + metrics bundle under this hub before resuming Phase G.
