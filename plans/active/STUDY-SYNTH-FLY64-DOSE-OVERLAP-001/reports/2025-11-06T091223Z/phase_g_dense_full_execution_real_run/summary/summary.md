### Turn Summary
Orchestrated a fresh ready-for-implementation plan to finish the dense Phase C→G pipeline and attach a post-run verification script before documenting results.
Verified there is no active orchestrator, noted the previous hub lacks Phase D–G artifacts, and provisioned the new 2025-11-06T091223Z evidence hub with updated input.md and fix_plan entries.
Next: Ralph implements the checker, reruns the pipeline to `[8/8]`, captures the metrics bundle with verification logs, and records MS-SSIM/MAE deltas plus metadata compliance evidence.
