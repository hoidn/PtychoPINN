### Turn Summary
Outlined a TDD hand-off to enforce per-phase CLI log coverage before executing the dense Phase C→G pipeline.
Flagged the missing pipeline artifacts as the remaining blocker and built a plan that pairs new tests with a full rerun + verifier evidence.
Next: Ralph implements the per-phase CLI checks, runs the orchestrator into the new hub, and captures verifier + metrics outputs.
