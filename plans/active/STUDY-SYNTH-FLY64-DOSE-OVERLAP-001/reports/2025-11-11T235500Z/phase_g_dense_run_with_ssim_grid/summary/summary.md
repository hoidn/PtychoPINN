### Turn Summary
Drafted the dense-run plus ssim_grid integration plan and updated docs/fix_plan, input.md, and galph_memory so Ralph has a concrete Do Now that hooks the helper into run_phase_g_dense.
Confirmed the prior 2025-11-11T013612Z hub already contains RED/GREEN pytest evidence while the newer dense hubs remain empty, so the new instructions target orchestrator updates plus a counted Phase C→G rerun with verification and doc sync.
Next: integrate the ssim_grid invocation/tests, run the full pipeline with --clobber into 2025-11-11T235500Z, then capture verifier outputs, MS-SSIM/MAE tables, and TESTING_GUIDE/TEST_SUITE_INDEX updates before handing back.
