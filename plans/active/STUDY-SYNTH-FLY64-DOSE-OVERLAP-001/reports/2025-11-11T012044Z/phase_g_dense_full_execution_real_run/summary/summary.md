### Turn Summary
Created the 2025-11-11T012044Z hub and documented the preview guard follow-through together with the outstanding dense-run evidence needs.
Updated docs/fix_plan.md, galph_memory.md, and input.md with the new doc/test/pipeline Do Now anchored to PREVIEW-PHASE-001.
Next: Ralph updates the docs, archives the pytest + pipeline logs, runs verify/highlights, and records MS-SSIM/MAE deltas under the new hub.
