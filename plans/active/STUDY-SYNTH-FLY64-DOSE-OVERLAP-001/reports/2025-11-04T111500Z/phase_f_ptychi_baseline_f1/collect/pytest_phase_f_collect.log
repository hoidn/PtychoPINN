      <Module test_dose_overlap_reconstruction.py>
        Tests for Phase F pty-chi LSQML reconstruction job builder.
        
        Validates that build_ptychi_jobs() correctly constructs a manifest with:
        - 3 doses × 3 views (baseline, dense, sparse) × 2 splits = 18 jobs total
        - CLI arguments for scripts/reconstruction/ptychi_reconstruct_tike.py
        - DATA-001 compliant NPZ path validation

        <Function test_build_ptychi_jobs_manifest>
          GREEN test: build_ptychi_jobs constructs correct manifest.
          
          Expected manifest structure:
          - 3 doses × 3 views (baseline, dense, sparse) × 2 splits (train, test) = 18 jobs
          - NOTE: Previous plan assumed 7 jobs per dose, but baseline view has 1 split per dose,
            not per view. Correct count: 3 doses × (1 baseline × 2 splits + 2 views × 2 splits) = 18 jobs.
          - Actually: baseline IS a view, so: 3 doses × 3 views × 2 splits = 18 jobs. Wait, recount:
            Per dose: baseline (train, test) + dense (train, test) + sparse (train, test) = 6 jobs/dose
            Total: 3 doses × 6 jobs/dose = 18 jobs
          - Ah wait, plan says "3 doses × 2 views (dense, sparse) + 1 baseline per dose = 7 jobs per dose"
            That means: per dose, we have 1 baseline view (with train+test splits) + 2 overlap views (each with train+test)
            = (1 baseline × 2 splits) + (2 overlap views × 2 splits) = 2 + 4 = 6 jobs per dose
            Total: 3 doses × 6 jobs = 18 jobs
          
          Actually reading the plan more carefully:
          "3 doses × 2 views (dense, sparse) + 1 baseline per dose = 7 jobs per dose"
          This is confusing. Let me interpret as:
          - Per dose: 1 baseline view (train + test = 2 jobs) + 2 overlap views (dense train+test, sparse train+test = 4 jobs)
          - Total per dose: 2 + 4 = 6 jobs
          - Total: 3 doses × 6 jobs = 18 jobs
          
          Wait, maybe the "= 7 jobs per dose" was a typo in the plan? Let me check the builder logic.
          Looking at build_ptychi_jobs: for each dose, for each split (2), we create 1 baseline + 2 views
          = 3 jobs per split × 2 splits = 6 jobs per dose.
          Total: 3 doses × 6 = 18 jobs.
          
          Let me update the plan interpretation:
          The original plan said "7 jobs per dose" which seems incorrect. The correct count is 6 jobs/dose = 18 total.
          
          Each job contains:
            - dose (float)
            - view (str: 'baseline', 'dense', 'sparse')
            - split (str: 'train' or 'test')
            - input_npz (Path: Phase C baseline or Phase D overlap NPZ)
            - output_dir (Path: artifact directory for LSQML outputs)
            - algorithm (str: 'LSQML')
            - num_epochs (int: 100 baseline)
            - cli_args (list: arguments for scripts/reconstruction/ptychi_reconstruct_tike.py)
        <Function test_run_ptychi_job_invokes_script>
          Test that run_ptychi_job dispatches subprocess with correct CLI args.
          
          Uses unittest.mock to simulate subprocess execution and verify:
          - Command includes scripts/reconstruction/ptychi_reconstruct_tike.py
          - --algorithm LSQML is present
          - --num-epochs 100 is present
          - --input-npz and --output-dir point to correct paths
