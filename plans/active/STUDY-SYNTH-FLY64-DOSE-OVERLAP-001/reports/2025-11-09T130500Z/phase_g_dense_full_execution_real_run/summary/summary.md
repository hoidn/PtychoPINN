### Turn Summary
Framed the next loop around adding provenance metadata to the dense Phase G delta JSON and executing the real pipeline run.
Captured the outstanding gap—no dense CLI evidence yet—by updating fix_plan/input with metadata-driven TDD plus pipeline steps and refreshing the artifacts hub.
Next: Ralph should extend the exec-mode pytest, implement metadata fields, then run the dense pipeline and archive MS-SSIM/MAE deltas + logs.
