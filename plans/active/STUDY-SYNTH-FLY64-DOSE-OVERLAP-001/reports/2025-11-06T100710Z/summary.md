### Turn Summary
Extended verify_dense_pipeline_artifacts.py with delta JSON/TXT validation functions enforcing TYPE-PATH-001 provenance and STUDY-001 schema; targeted tests passed cleanly.
Comprehensive suite passed except pre-existing ptychodus import failure (unrelated); Phase G dense orchestrator run launched but Phase C (1/8) still executing after 7+ minutes (expected TensorFlow simulation duration).
Next: Monitor pipeline completion, run enhanced verifier against full artifacts, and update fix_plan with evidence paths and completion status.
