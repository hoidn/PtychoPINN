### Turn Summary
Authored new 153500Z plan to close the dense pipeline filename-pattern gap and prepared the hub with plan/summary scaffolding.
Identified the verifier’s hard-coded CLI log names as incompatible with run_phase_g_dense outputs; refreshed input.md with TDD steps for pattern-aware matching and sentinel enforcement.
Next: Ralph extends validate_cli_logs with pattern/sentinel checks, runs the dense Phase C→G pipeline under the new hub, and records MS-SSIM/MAE deltas plus ledger updates.
