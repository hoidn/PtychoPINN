### Turn Summary
Audited the 170500Z dense pipeline run and confirmed it stopped after Phase C without producing metrics artifacts.
Captured status evidence (logs empty, process absent) and updated docs/fix_plan.md with a relaunch handoff plus failure-guard requirement.
Next: Ralph hardens the digest script, reruns the highlights preview, relaunches the dense pipeline, and records the resulting metrics digest.
