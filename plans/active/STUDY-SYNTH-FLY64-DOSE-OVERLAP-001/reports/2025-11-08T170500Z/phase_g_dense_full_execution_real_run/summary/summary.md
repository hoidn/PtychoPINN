### Turn Summary
Set up the 170500Z dense Phase C→G evidence hub and mapped next implementation to rerun the pipeline after the validator fix.
Captured validator recovery context, refreshed findings alignment, and required Ralph to ship a metrics digest script alongside the long run.
Next: Ralph reruns the highlights regression, executes the dense pipeline with --clobber, and generates the metrics_digest.md artifact.
