### Turn Summary
Implemented canonical transformation enforcement in Phase C metadata guard with full TDD coverage and doc updates.
RED confirmed guard did not require transpose_rename_convert; GREEN validated three behaviors (missing metadata, missing transformation, valid metadata acceptance).
Next: run dense orchestrator CLI with new guard to validate real Phase C→G pipeline execution and capture metrics summary evidence.
