### Turn Summary
Logged the metadata fix implementation in docs/fix_plan.md and staged a new 230500Z hub with input.md targeting Stage 5 regression plus dense rerun.
Reviewed previous pipeline failure logs and confirmed commit 3804a22a resolved the allow_pickle crash; dense metrics evidence still pending until rerun completes.
Next: Ralph adds the metadata-splits regression test, reruns the dense pipeline with --clobber, and generates metrics_digest.md for MS-SSIM/MAE updates.
