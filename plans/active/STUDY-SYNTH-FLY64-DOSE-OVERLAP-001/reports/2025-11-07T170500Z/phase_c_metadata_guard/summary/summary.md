### Turn Summary
Reaffirmed the missing Phase C metadata guard and authored an implementation-ready plan with explicit TDD plus CLI evidence steps.
Logged the refreshed hub, Do Now, and ledger notes so the next loop can capture guard RED→GREEN proofs without re-scoping.
Next: Ralph implements the guard helper, reruns targeted pytest selectors, and executes the dense orchestrator with logging.
