### Turn Summary
Provisioned the 2025-11-09T150500Z hub and TDD plan so the dense Phase G run will auto-emit metrics_delta_highlights.txt with provenance intact.
Refreshed docs/fix_plan.md and input.md with highlight automation scope, mapped selectors, and pipeline execution steps for the upcoming evidence loop.
Next: Ralph adds the highlights test + orchestrator emission, runs the dense pipeline with --clobber, and documents MS-SSIM/MAE deltas from the real artifacts.
