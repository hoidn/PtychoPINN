# Phase G Dense Full Execution — Loop Notes (2025-11-08T070500Z)

### Turn Summary
Drafted a ready-for-implementation plan for the dense Phase G evidence run, including a regression test covering the reporting helper execution and full CLI instructions.
Reconfirmed the outstanding gap is the real Phase C→G run and captured guardrails/findings to keep the orchestration path aligned.
Next: Ralph authors the new orchestrator test, runs the dense pipeline with --clobber, and updates docs with the recorded metrics.
