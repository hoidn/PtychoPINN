- Latest Attempt (2025-11-11T013612Z): done — SSIM grid helper + TDD smoke test. Verified `ssim_grid.py` (Tier-2 CLI) and `test_smoke_ssim_grid` execute RED→GREEN TDD cycle: RED phase confirms preview guard rejects amplitude contamination (exit code 1), GREEN phase proves helper succeeds with phase-only preview and emits ±0.000/±0.000000 formatted markdown tables. Artifacts: helper CLI script at plans/active/STUDY-SYNTH-FLY64-DOSE-OVERLAP-001/bin/ssim_grid.py:1-217, test at tests/study/test_ssim_grid.py:1-144, pytest logs + sample outputs under plans/active/STUDY-SYNTH-FLY64-DOSE-OVERLAP-001/reports/2025-11-11T013612Z/ssim_grid_mvp/{green,red,collect,analysis}/. Next: run full orchestrator to generate real Phase G artifacts, then invoke `ssim_grid.py` on live metrics_delta_summary.json.
