### Turn Summary
Re-centered the stalled Phase G focus on a concrete deliverable: a reusable ssim_grid helper plus pytest smoke guard so dense runs stop waiting on full pipelines.
Captured findings references, refreshed docs/fix_plan.md, and provisioned the 2025-11-11T013612Z hub with plan.md/input.md directing Ralph to implement the helper/test with RED→GREEN evidence.
Next: Ralph should follow the new Do Now, ship the helper + pytest logs under this hub, then we can schedule the follow-up dense run using the generated summary table.
