### Turn Summary
Outlined new TDD guard for the Phase G dense verifier and provisioned the 2025-11-10T093500Z hub for the evidence rerun.
Verified prior hubs still lack Phase D–G outputs and refreshed docs/fix_plan.md plus galph_memory.md to capture the gap and new instructions.
Next: Ralph implements the verifier inventory helper, drives RED→GREEN tests, and executes the dense pipeline end-to-end.
