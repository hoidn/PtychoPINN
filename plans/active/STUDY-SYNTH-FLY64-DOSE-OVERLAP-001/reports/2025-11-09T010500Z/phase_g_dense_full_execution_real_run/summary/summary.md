### Turn Summary
Reserved 2025-11-09T010500Z hub and captured plan to add analyze-digest regression coverage ahead of the dense rerun.
Dense pipeline metrics remain outstanding until Ralph executes the rerun and digest per the new instructions.
Next: implement the new pytest regression, run Phase C→G with --clobber, and generate the digest plus summary/doc updates.
