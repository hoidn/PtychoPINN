### Turn Summary
Provisioned 2025-11-08T110500Z hub with plan for dense Phase C→G evidence and stdout highlights preview instructions.
Updated docs/fix_plan.md and input.md to mandate the preview implementation, mapped pytest selectors, and scripted the dense run with --clobber.
Next: Ralph adds the preview, runs targeted tests, executes the dense pipeline, and archives metrics/highlights per plan.
