### Turn Summary
Queued a TDD plan to add a metrics delta stdout block to the Phase G orchestrator and staged the 2025-11-09T090500Z evidence hub.
Documented the attempt in docs/fix_plan.md and rewrote input.md so Ralph drives the helper implementation plus long pipeline execution.
Dense Phase C→G run is still outstanding; next step is to follow the RED→GREEN script then launch the pipeline under the new hub.
