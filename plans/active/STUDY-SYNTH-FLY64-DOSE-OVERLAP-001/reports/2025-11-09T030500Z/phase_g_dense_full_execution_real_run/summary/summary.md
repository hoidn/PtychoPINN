### Turn Summary
Aligned fix plan with the new failure-path regression and staged the 030500Z hub for the dense Phase C→G rerun plus digest evidence capture.
Documented that the 010500Z hub still lacks CLI/analysis outputs and drafted a success-banner regression + pipeline rerun plan for Ralph.
Next: implement the success banner/test, then execute the dense pipeline and generate metrics_digest.md with MS-SSIM/MAE deltas recorded.
