# Phase E6 Dense/Baseline Evidence — Planning Loop (2025-11-06T17:05:00Z)

- Confirmed Path normalization bug fixed last loop; Phase E6 real-run evidence still outstanding.
- Reviewed prior RED/GREEN logs and plan hub to reuse deterministic CLI commands and archive script.
- Drafted refreshed Do Now emphasizing SHA parity test enhancement, deterministic CLI runs, archive proof, and TYPE-PATH-001 documentation.
- Findings consulted: POLICY-001, CONFIG-001, DATA-001, OVERSAMPLING-001; new TYPE-PATH-001 needs ledger entry referencing this hub.
- Next step (Ralph): execute strengthened test + CLI runs per `input.md`, archive outputs, update docs, and log attempt in `docs/fix_plan.md`.
