### Turn Summary
Identified that the dense highlights preview guard still allows amplitude text, recorded PREVIEW-PHASE-001, and drafted the hardened validator/doc plan.
Rebuilt input.md + plan.md for the 2025-11-11T005802Z hub, refreshed docs/fix_plan.md/galph_memory.md, and staged artifacts so Ralph can follow the new TDD loop.
Next: implement the preview-phase-only guard + tests, update docs, and run run_phase_g_dense.py with verifier/highlights evidence under the new hub.
