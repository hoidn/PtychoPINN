### Turn Summary
Provisioned hub 2025-11-08T130500Z and refreshed plan/input so the dense Phase C→G pipeline can run with highlights preview evidence captured cleanly.
Revalidated applicable findings, updated docs/fix_plan.md and galph_memory.md, and mapped the commands for rerunning the highlights preview test plus the `--clobber` orchestrator execution.
The dense execution itself is still pending; Ralph now needs to run the pipeline, archive artifacts, and summarize the real MS-SSIM/MAE deltas.
Artifacts: plans/active/STUDY-SYNTH-FLY64-DOSE-OVERLAP-001/reports/2025-11-08T130500Z/phase_g_dense_full_execution_real_run/ (plan/plan.md, summary/summary.md, staging dirs)
