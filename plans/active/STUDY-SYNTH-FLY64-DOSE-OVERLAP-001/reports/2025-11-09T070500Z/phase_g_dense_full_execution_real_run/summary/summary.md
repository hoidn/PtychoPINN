### Turn Summary
Scoped the dense Phase G evidence loop to expose metrics digest paths in the orchestrator banner and schedule a fresh real run.
Reviewed prior hub outputs and findings to confirm digest automation is green but evidence pending; provisioned the 2025-11-09T070500Z hub with plan.md and updated input.md/fix_plan.md.
Next: Ralph tightens the exec test, surfaces digest/log paths, executes the dense pipeline, and records MS-SSIM/MAE deltas.
