### Turn Summary
Diagnosed recent stalls: repeated hub scaffolding without execution, CLI-log tweak cycles, and doc drift on delta precision and preview artifacts.
Classified last hubs (8 with pytest evidence, 4 prep-only), proposed guardrails and a two-loop MVP with a minimal ssim_grid driver + smoke test.
Next: implement ssim_grid.py with a smoke test, enforce preview-phase-only rule and precision, then run one real dense pipeline to publish the grid summary.
