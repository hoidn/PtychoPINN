### Turn Summary
Set up the 2025-11-09T210500Z hub with a TDD-focused plan so dense Phase G inventory automation ships alongside the full pipeline rerun.
Verified prior hubs only contain Phase C outputs, refreshed fix_plan/input with the new RED→GREEN guard, and prepped verifier + artifact paths for the evidence run.
Next: Ralph adds the failing orchestrator test, implements inventory emission, runs the dense pipeline, executes the verifier, and captures MS-SSIM/MAE deltas in summary/docs.
