# Phase D — Group-Level Overlap Filtering (Pending)

**Initiative:** STUDY-SYNTH-FLY64-DOSE-OVERLAP-001
**Phase:** D — Dense/Sparse Overlap Views
**Status:** Pending implementation — awaiting Phase D execution per plan.

## Expected Deliverables
- `studies/fly64_dose_overlap/overlap.py` with spacing utilities and `generate_overlap_views` orchestration.
- Pytest coverage in `tests/study/test_dose_overlap_overlap.py` exercising spacing enforcement and pipeline wiring.
- CLI run logs plus spacing metrics JSON under `metrics/<dose>/<view>.json`.

## Artifact Hub
`plans/active/STUDY-SYNTH-FLY64-DOSE-OVERLAP-001/reports/2025-11-04T034242Z/phase_d_overlap_filtering/`

## Notes
- Findings in play: CONFIG-001, DATA-001, OVERSAMPLING-001.
- Update this file with spacing statistics, acceptance ratios, and validator evidence once Phase D completes.
