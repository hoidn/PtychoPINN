### Turn Summary
Phase A verified complete (commit 3e877cde, test passing). Now advancing to Phase B: lazy loading implementation.
Wrote input.md with tasks to implement `__getattr__` lazy loading, move model construction into `_build_module_level_models()`, and add `test_import_no_side_effects`.
Next: Ralph implements Phase B and runs both tests to verify import-time side effects are eliminated.
