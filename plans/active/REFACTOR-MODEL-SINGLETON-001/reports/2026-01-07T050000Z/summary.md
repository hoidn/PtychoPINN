### Turn Summary
Verified Phase B completion (2/2 tests pass: lazy loading prevents import-time model creation).
Analyzed Phase C scope and identified that XLA trace caching needs spike validation before removing workarounds.
Next: Ralph implements XLA spike test to verify multi-N works with XLA enabled.
