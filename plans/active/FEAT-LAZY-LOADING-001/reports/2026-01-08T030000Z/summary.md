### Turn Summary
Verified Phase B completion — lazy tensor allocation in `PtychoDataContainer` is working (8/8 tests pass, commit 37985157).
Updated implementation.md checkboxes to reflect B1-B6 done; expanded Phase C with clearer tasks (C1-C4).
Prepared Phase C handoff: update `train()` function to accept `use_streaming` parameter for memory-efficient large dataset training.
Next: Ralph implements streaming support in model.py, adds integration test, runs all tests.
