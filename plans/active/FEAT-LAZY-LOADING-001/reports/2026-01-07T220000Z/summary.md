### Turn Summary
Verified Phase A complete (3 tests passing, commit 1d4b09f4) and designed Phase B lazy container implementation with 6 checklist items.
Analyzed `PtychoDataContainer` and `load()` usage patterns; designed property-based lazy access with caching and `as_tf_dataset()` for batched training.
Next: Ralph implements lazy container (B1-B4), updates tests (B5), runs regression tests (B6).
