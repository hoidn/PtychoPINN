# Stakeholder Brief Outline — Phase B.B3 Prep

This stub captures supervisor guidance ahead of the Phase B.B3 stakeholder brief.

## Objective
- Summarize canonical plan updates (Phase B.B2) for downstream initiatives (INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001, TEST-PYTORCH-001).
- Enumerate remaining decisions/open questions (D1–D3) and assign follow-up owners.

## Expected Deliverables for Phase B.B3 Execution
- `stakeholder_brief.md` covering:
  - Highlighted deltas introduced in `plans/ptychodus_pytorch_integration_plan.md` (sections 1–8).
  - Mapping of each delta to execution initiatives and spec sections.
  - Open questions requiring decision (API surface, config schema alignment, persistence format) with proposed decision forums.
  - Next actions for INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 (Phase B tasks) and TEST-PYTORCH-001 (fixture + test plan alignment).
- `open_questions.md` (optional) capturing unresolved blockers for governance review.

## Source Material
- `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000/reports/2025-10-17T025633Z/{plan_redline.md,summary.md}`
- `plans/ptychodus_pytorch_integration_plan.md`
- `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md`
- `plans/pytorch_integration_test_plan.md`

## Notes
- Keep emphasis on actionable requests for downstream initiatives.
- Reference `CONFIG-001` finding when reiterating configuration bridge urgency.
- Store final artifacts in this directory.
