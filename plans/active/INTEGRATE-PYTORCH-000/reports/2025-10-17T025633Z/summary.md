# Phase B.B1 Summary — INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000

**Date:** 2025-10-17T02:56:33Z  
**Artifacts:** `plan_redline.md`

## Outcomes
- Produced redline outline translating Critical Deltas 1-5 into concrete edits for `plans/ptychodus_pytorch_integration_plan.md`.
- Catalogued decision points (D1-D4) that must be resolved before committing canonical plan updates.
- Sequenced canonical editing order to guide Phase B.B2 execution without re-reading raw findings.

## Highlights
- Recast Phase 0 scope to address the newly introduced `ptycho_torch/api/` layer and associated MLflow orchestration.
- Elevated configuration schema divergence as explicit Phase 1 deliverable with mapping table requirements.
- Added data pipeline + reassembly parity expectations, including numeric validation against TensorFlow helpers.
- Captured persistence strategy debates (archive shim vs dual filters) to unblock later phases.

## Next Steps
1. **Phase B.B2 (Canonical Plan Update)** — Apply redline guidance to `plans/ptychodus_pytorch_integration_plan.md`, citing this artifact in commit notes.
2. **Phase B.B3 (Stakeholder Brief)** — Use decision inventory D1-D4 to solicit answers from INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 owner before reopening execution loops.
3. **Fix Ledger Update** — Record Attempt #2 with artifact path `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-000/reports/2025-10-17T025633Z/`.

## Open Questions
- Does the team want to preserve Lightning as the canonical orchestration layer, or fall back to bare PyTorch for minimal dependencies?
- Should spec updates occur during Phase B.B2 (documentation-first) or be deferred to execution phases after code changes prove parity?

## Recommended Input.md Guidance
- Direct engineer to implement B2 edits, referencing redline outline items 1-5.
- Emphasize updating canonical plan before touching code to keep execution initiatives unblocked.
