### Turn Summary
Marked ORCH-ROUTER-001 complete and reopened ORCH-ORCHESTRATOR-001 for Phase E combined review cadence parity.
Updated the ORCH-ORCHESTRATOR implementation plan with the new Phase E checklist, reserved the artifacts hub, and drafted input.md directing Ralph to add the regression plus doc/test updates.
Next: Ralph lands the combined-mode review cadence test, syncs docs/test registries, and runs both targeted pytest selectors.
