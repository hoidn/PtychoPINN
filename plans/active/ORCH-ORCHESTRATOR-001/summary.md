# ORCH-ORCHESTRATOR-001 Summary

### Turn Summary
Drafted a minimal design and phased implementation plan for the combined orchestrator, including a shared runner refactor.
Captured a draft test strategy focused on stubbed prompt execution and local/sync mode state transitions.
Confirmed behavioral decisions: galph-only review cadence, galph-only router override, sequential combined mode, failure stops fast, and identical state/logging.
Next: translate the decisions into Phase A tests and update the runner/orchestrator interfaces accordingly.
