### Turn Summary
Scoped the photon_grid_study baseline for the maintainer’s D0 parity request and flipped seed to in_progress.
Captured dataset/probe facts plus checksum targets and drafted Ralph’s Do Now to script the snapshot + write the inbox response.
Next: implement the snapshot script, author inbox/maintainer reply, and run the pytest placeholder guard.
