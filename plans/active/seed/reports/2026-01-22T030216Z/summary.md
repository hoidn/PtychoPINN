### Turn Summary
Re-anchored the seed focus on S3 and refreshed input.md so the D0 parity logger CLI + tests have clear implementation + doc-sync steps tied to the maintainer spec.
Documented the git pull blockers from the user's large dirty tree and captured the new artifact timestamp + guardrails for Ralph.
Next: Ralph implements scripts/tools/d0_parity_logger.py with helper stats plus tests/tools/test_d0_parity_logger.py::test_cli_emits_outputs and runs the CLI on photon_grid_study_20250826_152459.
