### Turn Summary
Scoped the D0 parity logger CLI/test requirements into a reusable blueprint and logged them in fix_plan so S3 has an implementation-ready target.
Reframed the focus on building scripts/tools/d0_parity_logger.py with raw/grouped/normalized stats plus a unit test, then rewrote input.md with precise Do Now/test/doc-sync guidance.
Next: Ralph implements the CLI + test, runs pytest/collect-only, executes the logger on photon_grid_study_20250826_152459, and archives the resulting JSON/MD/CSV outputs.
