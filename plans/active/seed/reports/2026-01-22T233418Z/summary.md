### Turn Summary
Scoped the D0 parity logger follow-up so the Markdown exposes multi-dose stage stats alongside the doc/test sync instructions.
Inspected scripts/tools/d0_parity_logger.py::write_markdown, tests/tools/test_d0_parity_logger.py, and the testing docs to confirm the missing coverage and CLI selector drift.
Authored input.md plus a How-To map (pytest + CLI rerun commands) and reserved artifacts directory 2026-01-22T233418Z for Ralph's outputs.
Next: Ralph implements the per-dataset Markdown tables, expands tests/docs, and re-runs the CLI/test suite per the Do Now.
Artifacts: plans/active/seed/reports/2026-01-22T233418Z/ (input.md)
