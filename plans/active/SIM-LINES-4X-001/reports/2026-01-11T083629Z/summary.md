### Turn Summary
Adjusted SIM-LINES-4X counts so gs2 uses 8000 total images with 4000/4000 splits and group_count=1000.
Reran gs2 ideal and integration scenarios; outputs saved under .artifacts/sim_lines_4x with logs captured.
Stitch warnings appeared during gs2 inference, but reconstructions were still written.
Next: rerun gs1 scenarios if you want refreshed outputs with the same scaling rules.
