# Phase B2.C/B2.D Fixture Generator Run (Placeholder)

- Initiative: TEST-PYTORCH-001 — PyTorch integration regression
- Scope: Phase B2.C (generator implementation) and B2.D (fixture metadata documentation)
- Reserved Artifacts:
  - `fixture_generation.log` — CLI run output for `make_pytorch_integration_fixture.py`
  - `pytest_fixture_green.log` — Targeted selector log showing all fixture tests GREEN
  - `fixture_notes.md` — Checksums, regeneration command, runtime notes

Populate this summary once the generator implementation completes. Include:
1. Commands executed (with CLI flags / env vars)
2. Resulting fixture paths + SHA256 checksum
3. Measured runtime impact vs canonical dataset
4. Follow-up actions for Phase B3
