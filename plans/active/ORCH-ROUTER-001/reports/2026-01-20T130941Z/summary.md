### Turn Summary
Reopened ORCH-ROUTER-001 for Phase E and refreshed docs/fix_plan plus the plan/summary so router review cadence persistence is explicit, blocking ORCH-ORCHESTRATOR until it lands.
Documented the manual override hygiene by aligning the DEBUG-SIM-LINES implementation plan status with the active Phase D amplitude-bias scope and logging the fix-plan attempt.
Authored the new Do Now directing Ralph to persist `last_prompt_actor` in supervisor/loop, add the sync router review cadence pytest module, and archive evidence under the new hub.
