### R&D Plan (`plan.md`)
# R&D Plan: Probe Generalization Study

*Created: 2025-07-22*

## üéØ **OBJECTIVE & HYPOTHESIS**

**Project/Initiative Name:** Probe Generalization Study

**Problem Statement:** The impact of using different probe functions (idealized vs. experimental) on the performance of PtychoPINN models, particularly with different overlap constraints (gridsize=1 vs. gridsize=2), is not well understood. Additionally, the viability of the synthetic 'lines' dataset workflow post-refactor needs verification.

**Proposed Solution / Hypothesis:**
- By verifying the synthetic 'lines' simulation path, we can confirm its readiness for controlled experiments.
- By implementing a clear workflow to use an external probe from a file, we can systematically test the model's sensitivity to the probe function.
- We hypothesize that models trained with a realistic experimental probe will show better generalization when tested on experimental data, and that gridsize=2 models will be more robust to variations in the probe function due to the overlap constraint.

**Scope & Deliverables:**
1. Verification that synthetic 'lines' datasets can be generated and trained for both gridsize=1 and gridsize=2.
2. A clear, documented workflow for using a probeGuess from an external .npz file in the simulation pipeline.
3. A final `2x2_comparison_report.md` file summarizing the quantitative results (PSNR, SSIM, FRC50) of the four experimental conditions.
4. A final `2x2_comparison_plot.png` visualizing the reconstructed amplitude and phase for all four conditions.

## üõ†Ô∏è **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

**Key Modules to Modify/Use:**
- `scripts/simulation/run_with_synthetic_lines.py`: To verify the existing workflow.
- `scripts/simulation/simulate_and_save.py`: This script already supports the required feature. The key is to provide it with an `--input-file` that contains the desired probeGuess and a synthetic objectGuess.
- `scripts/run_comparison.sh`: To execute the training and comparison for each of the four experimental arms.

**The Four Experimental Arms:**
1. **Idealized Probe / Gridsize 1**: Train PtychoPINN (gridsize=1) on a synthetic 'lines' object simulated with the standard default probe.
2. **Idealized Probe / Gridsize 2**: Train PtychoPINN (gridsize=2) on the same 'lines' object with the standard default probe.
3. **Experimental Probe / Gridsize 1**: Train PtychoPINN (gridsize=1) on the same 'lines' object, but simulated using the experimental probe from `datasets/fly64/fly001_64_train_converted.npz`.
4. **Experimental Probe / Gridsize 2**: Train PtychoPINN (gridsize=2) on the same 'lines' object with the experimental probe.

**Key Technical Requirements:**
- Extract experimental probe from existing dataset: `datasets/fly64/fly001_64_train_converted.npz`
- Create automation script to orchestrate all 4 experimental conditions
- Ensure consistent synthetic 'lines' object across all conditions for fair comparison
- Leverage existing comparison framework for standardized metrics and visualization

---

## ‚úÖ **VALIDATION & VERIFICATION PLAN**

**Unit / Integration Tests:**
- A new test in `tests/test_simulation.py` that verifies the `run_with_synthetic_lines.py` script successfully generates a valid dataset for both gridsize=1 and gridsize=2.
- Verification that experimental probe extraction and integration works correctly.
- The final 2x2 experiment serves as the ultimate integration test, verifying that the entire pipeline (simulation ‚Üí training ‚Üí comparison) works correctly for all four conditions.

**Success Criteria:**
1. The `run_with_synthetic_lines.py` workflow runs without error for both grid sizes.
2. The simulation successfully uses the externally provided experimental probe.
3. All four training runs complete successfully and produce valid models.
4. The final `2x2_comparison_report.md` and `2x2_comparison_plot.png` are generated successfully and contain plausible results for all four experimental arms.
5. Quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, FRC50) show meaningful differences between conditions, validating the experimental design.

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- Each training run should complete within reasonable time bounds (similar to existing generalization studies)
- Memory usage should remain within system constraints
- All generated datasets should conform to data contract specifications

---

## üéØ **PHASE-BASED IMPLEMENTATION**

**Overall Goal:** To systematically evaluate the impact of probe function variations (idealized vs. experimental) on PtychoPINN model performance across different overlap constraints through a controlled 2x2 experimental study.

**Total Estimated Duration:** 3 days + compute time

---

## üìã **IMPLEMENTATION PHASES**

### **Phase 1: Housekeeping & Workflow Verification**

**Goal:** To perform targeted code cleanup and verify that the existing synthetic 'lines' workflow functions correctly for both gridsize=1 and gridsize=2, adding a new unit test for this capability.

**Deliverable:** A cleaner codebase with a new unit test in `tests/test_simulation.py` that confirms the successful generation of 'lines' datasets for both grid sizes.

**Estimated Duration:** 1 day

**Key Tasks:**
- **Housekeeping:** Execute Phase 1 of the previously defined "Codebase Housekeeping" plan (centralize tests, archive example plans, remove legacy scripts).
- **Verification:** Run the `scripts/simulation/run_with_synthetic_lines.py` script for gridsize=1 and gridsize=2 to confirm it generates valid, trainable datasets.
- **Testing:** Add a new unit test to `tests/test_simulation.py` that automates this verification.

**Dependencies:** None (first phase)

**Implementation Checklist:** `phase_1_checklist.md`

**Success Test:** The new unit test passes, and `python -m unittest discover -s tests` runs successfully.

---

### **Phase 2: Experimental Probe Integration**

**Goal:** To create a reusable workflow for simulating data using the experimental probe from the fly64 dataset.

**Deliverable:** A new `.npz` file, `simulation_input_experimental_probe.npz`, containing a synthetic 'lines' object and the experimental probeGuess from `datasets/fly64/fly001_64_train_converted.npz`.

**Estimated Duration:** 0.5 days

**Key Tasks:**
- Write a small helper script to load the probeGuess from the fly64 dataset.
- Generate a standard synthetic 'lines' objectGuess.
- Save both arrays into a new .npz file that can be fed into `simulate_and_save.py`.
- Run a small test simulation using this new input file to verify it works.

**Dependencies:** Requires Phase 1 completion.

**Implementation Checklist:** `phase_2_checklist.md`

**Success Test:** The command `python scripts/simulation/simulate_and_save.py --input-file simulation_input_experimental_probe.npz` runs successfully.

---

### **Phase 3: Automated 2x2 Study Execution**

**Goal:** To automate and execute the full 2x2 probe generalization study, training all four model configurations.

**Deliverable:** A new orchestration script, `scripts/studies/run_probe_generalization_study.sh`, and the completed training outputs for all four experimental arms.

**Estimated Duration:** 1 day (plus compute time)

**Key Tasks:**
- Create the `run_probe_generalization_study.sh` script.
- The script will execute four separate runs of `run_comparison.sh`, correctly configuring the gridsize and the input data (simulated with either the default or experimental probe).
- Each run will have a distinct output directory (e.g., `probe_study/ideal_gs1`, `probe_study/exp_gs2`).

**Dependencies:** Requires Phase 2 completion.

**Implementation Checklist:** `phase_3_checklist.md`

**Success Test:** The script completes all four training and comparison runs without error, and each output directory contains a valid `comparison_metrics.csv` file.

---

### **Final Phase: Results Aggregation & Documentation**

**Goal:** To analyze the results from the four experiments, generate the final comparison report and plot, and document the findings.

**Deliverable:** The final `2x2_comparison_report.md` and `2x2_comparison_plot.png` artifacts, with the initiative archived.

**Estimated Duration:** 0.5 days

**Key Tasks:**
- Write a Python script to parse the four `comparison_metrics.csv` files.
- Generate the summary table and the 2x2 visualization plot.
- Write a brief analysis of the results in the markdown report.
- Update `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` to move this initiative to the "Completed" section.

**Dependencies:** All previous phases complete.

**Implementation Checklist:** `phase_final_checklist.md`

**Success Test:** All R&D plan success criteria are met, and the final artifacts are generated correctly.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **RISK MITIGATION**

**Potential Blockers:**
- **Risk:** The synthetic 'lines' workflow may fail on one of the grid sizes due to post-refactor changes.
  - **Mitigation:** Phase 1 verification will catch this early, allowing fixes before the main study.
- **Risk:** The experimental probe from fly64 dataset may be incompatible with the simulation pipeline.
  - **Mitigation:** Phase 2 includes validation step with test simulation before proceeding to full study.
- **Risk:** Training runs may fail due to memory constraints or other system issues.
  - **Mitigation:** The orchestration script will include error handling and resume capability.

**Rollback Plan:**
- **Git:** Each phase will be a separate, reviewed commit on the feature branch, allowing for easy reverts.
- **Incremental Validation:** Each phase produces a testable deliverable, preventing error propagation.
- **Existing Infrastructure:** Study leverages proven `run_comparison.sh` framework, minimizing risk of fundamental failures.
