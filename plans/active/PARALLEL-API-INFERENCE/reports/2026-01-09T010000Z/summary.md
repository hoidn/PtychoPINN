### Turn Summary
Verified G-scaled (STUDY-SYNTH-FLY64-DOSE-OVERLAP-001) is COMPLETE — all tests pass: lazy loading 14/15, model factory 3/3, integration 2/2.
Updated docs/fix_plan.md to mark G-scaled done; G-full remains blocked on BASELINE-CHUNKED-001/002 (separate Baseline OOM issue).
Selected PARALLEL-API-INFERENCE as next focus — initiative is in planning status and unblocked.
Next: Ralph explores TF inference code and documents extraction design for Task 1 (TF helper extraction).
