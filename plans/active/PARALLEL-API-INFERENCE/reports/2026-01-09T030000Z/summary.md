### Turn Summary
Verified Task 1 complete (TF helper extraction) — all 7 tests passed plus integration regression.
Discovered `scripts/pytorch_api_demo.py` already exists but uses old TF inference path; revised Task 2 scope to update it.
Next: Ralph updates demo script to use new `_run_tf_inference_and_reconstruct` helper and creates smoke test.
Artifacts: plans/active/PARALLEL-API-INFERENCE/reports/2026-01-09T030000Z/ (input.md prepared for Task 2-3)
