### Turn Summary
Closed REFACTOR-MEMOIZE-CORE-001 by ticking Phase C items and updating the ledger so the initiative can archive cleanly.
Brought PARALLEL-API-INFERENCE back online: refreshed plan/summary, set Do Now for swapping the demo’s TF branch over to `_run_tf_inference_and_reconstruct`, and pointed Ralph at quick pytest selectors.
Next: Ralph updates `scripts/pytorch_api_demo.py`, runs the mapped tests, and drops logs under the new report hub.
