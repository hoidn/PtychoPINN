### Turn Summary
Reran dose_response_study.py with 5 epochs, writing outputs to .artifacts/dose_response_study/2026-01-13T061238Z.
Run completed but logged an unexpected intensity ratio (~1.23e+00 vs ~1e5) and NaN losses during training.
Stitching warnings appeared at the end, though the script still wrote the figure and training history.
Next: decide whether to investigate the normalization/NaN regression or rerun with different settings.
