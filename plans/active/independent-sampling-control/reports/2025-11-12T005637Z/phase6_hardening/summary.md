### Turn Summary
Verified the Phase 6A guardrails (enable_oversampling/neighbor_pool_size plumbing, RawData gating, docs/tests) via hub 2025-11-12T005637Z/phase6_hardening so the initiative can close.
Marked the implementation plan + docs/fix_plan.md as complete, rewrote input.md to pivot back to the Phase G dense rerun blocker, and reminded Ralph to rerun from `/home/ollie/Documents/PtychoPINN` with the scalar-mask regression + geometry acceptance tests as guards.
Next: Ralph must run the listed pytest selectors, execute the counted dense pipeline with `--clobber`, immediately run the fully parameterized `--post-verify-only`, and publish the SSIM/verification/highlights/metrics/preview bundle before touching Phase E/comparison work.

### Turn Summary
Forced a Tier 3 dwell escalation on the Phase G dense rerun hub, captured analysis/dwell_escalation_report.md, and marked the initiative blocked until Ralph reruns the counted pipeline plus the post-verify sweep with the full SSIM/verification/highlights/preview/metrics bundle.
Spun up the Phase 6 oversampling guardrail focus, created the new reports hub, and rewrote docs/fix_plan.md + input.md with the explicit enable_oversampling/neighbor_pool_size implementation brief and pytest selectors.
Next: Ralph must acknowledge the dwell report before touching Phase G, then execute the Phase 6A guardrails (config/CLI plumbing, RawData gating, new tests/docs) and green the listed pytest selectors.
