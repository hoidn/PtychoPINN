### Turn Summary
Forced a Tier 3 dwell escalation on the Phase G dense rerun hub, captured analysis/dwell_escalation_report.md, and marked the initiative blocked until Ralph reruns the counted pipeline plus the post-verify sweep with the full SSIM/verification/highlights/preview/metrics bundle.
Spun up the Phase 6 oversampling guardrail focus, created the new reports hub, and rewrote docs/fix_plan.md + input.md with the explicit enable_oversampling/neighbor_pool_size implementation brief and pytest selectors.
Next: Ralph must acknowledge the dwell report before touching Phase G, then execute the Phase 6A guardrails (config/CLI plumbing, RawData gating, new tests/docs) and green the listed pytest selectors.
