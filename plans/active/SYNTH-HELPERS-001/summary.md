### Turn Summary
Added synthetic helpers for object/probe creation, nongrid simulation, and deterministic splits; refactored sim_lines_4x, dose_response_study (nongrid), and run_with_synthetic_lines to use them.
Implemented helper unit tests plus CLI --help smoke coverage and pipeline import smoke, then refreshed the test registry docs.
Ruff, targeted pytest, and collect-only runs all pass and are archived for evidence.
Next: close out the initiative or move to the next active focus in docs/fix_plan.md.
