### Turn Summary
Phase 1 gradient-clip config + compare-wrapper plumbing are verified with archived pytest logs, so AGC switching is fully wired end-to-end.
The implementation plan, docs/fix_plan.md, galph_memory.md, and input.md now spell out Phase 2 (StablePtychoBlock + stable_hybrid) per the writing-plans skill with mapped pytest selectors and log path.
Next: engineer implements Tasks 2.1–2.3 (stable block, registry/docs, CLI wiring) and captures the three mapped selectors under the new artifacts hub.
Artifacts: plans/active/FNO-STABILITY-OVERHAUL-001/reports/2026-01-28T050000Z/ (summary.md)
