### Turn Summary
Phase 2 implementation is verified and the plan’s Phase 3 section now details the Stage A shootout workflow (dataset sharing, three CLI arms, metrics summary script).
docs/fix_plan.md and galph_memory.md are synced to this state, with the workflow artifactory path reserved at plans/active/FNO-STABILITY-OVERHAUL-001/reports/2026-01-29T010000Z/ for Stage A logs.
Next: engineer executes Tasks 3.1–3.5 (control arm, stable_hybrid arm, AGC arm, metrics summary) and archives the resulting metrics/logs under the reserved report directory.
