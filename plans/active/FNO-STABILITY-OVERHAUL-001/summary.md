### Turn Summary
Closed GRID-LINES-WORKFLOW-001 (23/23 torch runner tests green) and created FNO-STABILITY-OVERHAUL-001 to execute the main strategy (stable_hybrid + AGC).
Codebase audit confirmed 0% of the stability strategy is implemented; all config, AGC utility, stable block, and registry changes are pending.
Next: engineer implements Phase 1 (gradient_clip_algorithm config, AGC utility, training_step dispatch, CLI flags).
Artifacts: plans/active/FNO-STABILITY-OVERHAUL-001/reports/2026-01-28T010000Z/ (implementation.md)
