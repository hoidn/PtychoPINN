# Artifact Inventory — FIX-PYTORCH-FORWARD-PARITY-001/forward_parity

## Phase A — Instrumentation + Short Baseline Rerun (2025-11-14, refreshed post-dc5415ba)

### Green Evidence (Tests Passing)
- green/pytest_patch_stats_rerun.log — Selector GREEN after post-payload-fix rerun (1/1 PASSED, 7.14s)
  - Confirms torch_patch_stats.json/torch_patch_grid.png emission
  - log_patch_stats/patch_stats_limit flags working via payload handoff (dc5415ba)
- green/pytest_patch_stats_payload_handoff.log — Original payload handoff fix (1/1 PASSED, 7.14s)

### CLI Evidence (Training + Inference)
- cli/train_patch_stats_rerun.log — 10-epoch training run with instrumentation (post-dc5415ba)
  - Dataset: fly001_reconstructed_final_downsampled_data_train.npz (256 images, gridsize=2)
  - Flags: --log-patch-stats --patch-stats-limit 2
  - Output: outputs/torch_forward_parity_baseline
  - Completed successfully, model saved to wts.h5.zip
  - Torch patch stats logged for train batch 0 (mean=0.00451, std=0.00784, var_zero_mean=6.15e-05)
- cli/inference_patch_stats_rerun.log — Inference run with debug dump (post-dc5415ba)
  - Model: outputs/torch_forward_parity_baseline
  - Dataset: fly001_reconstructed_final_downsampled_data_test.npz (128 images)
  - Flags: --log-patch-stats --patch-stats-limit 2 --debug-dump
  - Completed successfully
  - Torch patch stats logged for inference batch 0 (mean=0.000004, std=0.000127, var_zero_mean=0.0)

### Analysis Artifacts
- analysis/torch_patch_stats.json — Per-patch statistics (2 training batches, post-dc5415ba)
  - Train phase batch 0 (first occurrence): mean=0.00451, std=0.00784, var_zero_mean=6.15e-05
  - Train phase batch 0 (second occurrence): mean=0.00451, std=0.00784, var_zero_mean=6.15e-05
  - Non-zero variance confirms patches have meaningful structure
  - Higher variance than previous Nov 14 run (3.33e-05 → 6.15e-05), likely due to different dataset
- analysis/torch_patch_grid.png — Normalized patch visualization (7.4KB)
  - Shows first 2 batches of training patches
- analysis/forward_parity_debug/ — Inference debug dump (post-dc5415ba)
  - canvas.json — Canvas metadata
  - offsets.json — Patch offset information
  - pred_patches_amp_grid.png — Amplitude patches (unnormalized, 37KB)
  - pred_patches_amp_grid_normalized.png — Amplitude patches (normalized, 41KB)
  - stats.json — Inference statistics

### Code Changes (Commit dc5415ba)
- ptycho_torch/workflows/components.py — Training payload threading
  - Added training_payload parameter to run_cdi_example_torch, train_cdi_model_torch, _train_with_lightning
  - Conditional logic: reuse payload when provided, rebuild via factory otherwise
- ptycho_torch/train.py — Pass payload at line 756

### Next Steps
- Phase A checklist items A0/A1/A2/A3 complete
- Fresh evidence captured post-payload-handoff fix (dc5415ba)
- Ready for Phase B: scaling/config alignment (object_big defaults, intensity_scale persistence)
