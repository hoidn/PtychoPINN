# Artifact Inventory — FIX-PYTORCH-FORWARD-PARITY-001/forward_parity

## Phase A — Instrumentation Nucleus (2025-11-16)

### Green Evidence (Tests Passing)
- green/pytest_patch_stats_payload_handoff.log — Selector GREEN after payload handoff fix (1/1 PASSED, 7.14s)
  - Artifacts created: torch_patch_stats.json (2 batches with var_zero_mean), torch_patch_grid.png (390×290 PNG)
  - Confirms CLI TrainingPayload now threads through to _train_with_lightning
  - log_patch_stats/patch_stats_limit flags preserved via payload reuse

### Code Changes (Commit dc5415ba)
- ptycho_torch/workflows/components.py — Added training_payload parameter to run_cdi_example_torch, train_cdi_model_torch, _train_with_lightning
  - Conditional logic: reuse payload when provided, otherwise rebuild via factory (backward compat)
- ptycho_torch/train.py — Pass payload to run_cdi_example_torch at line 756

### Next Steps
- Execute short baseline training + inference commands with instrumentation flags
- Capture CLI logs and artifacts under hub/cli/ and hub/analysis/
- Verify JSON/PNG artifacts appear in output_dir/analysis/
