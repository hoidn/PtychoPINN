### Turn Summary
Reopened DOC-HYGIENE-20260120, blocked ORCH-AGENT-DISPATCH-001, and aligned docs/fix_plan with the reviewer override plus a new plan/test strategy + reports hub.
Drafted the phased plan and Do Now covering orchestration.yaml, prompt references, and supervisor --no-git gating/tests so Ralph can land the hygiene fixes next loop.
Next: Ralph implements the config/prompt edits, wires the supervisor guard + tests, runs the mapped selectors, and archives logs under the plan hub.
