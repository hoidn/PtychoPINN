### Turn Summary
Verified DOC-HYGIENE-20260120 Phase A/C landed (orchestration.yaml, prompt hygiene, supervisor --no-git tests) and synced docs/fix_plan plus the implementation plan with the actual state.
Scoped Phase B3 spec-bootstrap alignment so config defaults, init scripts, and prompts all point at specs/ with legacy fallbacks, and opened the 2026-01-21T000742Z artifacts hub for upcoming evidence.
Next: Ralph updates SpecBootstrapConfig + init scripts to honor specs/ (with pytest coverage) and refreshes README/prompt references before rerunning the mapped selectors.
