# DOC-HYGIENE-20260120 Summary

### Turn Summary
Reopened the reviewer doc/prompt hygiene initiative after user_input proved the root orchestration config, prompt references, and supervisor `--no-git` guard are still missing.
Drafted a full phased plan + test strategy and reserved the new reports hub so Ralph can add `orchestration.yaml`, fix the prompts, and land the supervisor gating/tests under one initiative.
Next: implement Phase A/B/C per plan (docs, config, supervisor code/tests) with pytest evidence and doc/test registry updates tied to `plans/active/DOC-HYGIENE-20260120/reports/2026-01-20T235033Z/`.
