# Supervisor Summary â€” 2025-10-18T031500Z

- B2 green-phase handoff prep: verified `_train_with_lightning` stub still unchanged and TestTrainWithLightningRed remains red.
- No engineer artifacts yet under this timestamp; directory reserved for implementation log + green pytest run.
- Next loop should implement Phase B.B2 steps from `phase_b2_implementation.md`, capture targeted pytest log as `pytest_train_green.log`, and update this summary with results.
