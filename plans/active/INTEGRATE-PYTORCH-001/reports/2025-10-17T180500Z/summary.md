# Loop Summary — Phase E1.C Backend Selection Blueprint

- Authored `phase_e_backend_design.md` defining configuration flag, dispatcher strategy, fail-fast guards, and validation plan for backend selection.
- Broke implementation into tasks E1.C1–E1.C4 covering dataclass updates, PyTorch adapter propagation, Ptychodus dispatcher wiring, and test instrumentation.
- Highlighted dependency on CONFIG-001 compliance, existing Phase D handoff artifacts, and upcoming TEST-PYTORCH-001 coordination.
- Provided TDD guidance (selectors, artifact logging) for Ralph to execute in the next loop.
