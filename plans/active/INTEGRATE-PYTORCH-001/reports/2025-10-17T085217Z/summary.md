# Phase D Planning Summary (2025-10-17T085217Z)

## Scope
- Focus: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 Phase D (workflow orchestration + persistence).
- Artifacts authored: `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/phase_d_workflow.md` (phased checklist) and implementation plan updates referencing the new checklist.

## Key Decisions
- Treat Phase D as four sub-phases (design, orchestration implementation, persistence bridge, regression hooks) with explicit checklist IDs (D1.A–D4.C).
- Require evidence artifacts per sub-phase under timestamped `phase_d_*` filenames to maintain traceability with docs/fix_plan.md attempts.
- Defer MLflow dependency decision to D1.C with explicit pros/cons doc before any code changes.

## References Consulted
- `specs/ptychodus_api_spec.md` §4 (reconstructor lifecycle requirements).
- `docs/architecture.md` §3–4 (workflow + data pipeline relationships).
- `docs/workflows/pytorch.md` (current PyTorch execution path + parity considerations).
- `plans/ptychodus_pytorch_integration_plan.md` Phases 4–6 (orchestration + persistence milestones).
- `ptycho/workflows/components.py` (TensorFlow run_cdi_example orchestration).
- `ptycho/model_manager.py` (TensorFlow persistence contract).
- `ptycho_torch/train.py` / `ptycho_torch/inference.py` (existing PyTorch workflow surface).

## Next Steps for Engineering Loop
1. Execute D1.A–D1.C from the new checklist, storing artifacts under `reports/<timestamp>/phase_d_*`.
2. Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempts History with produced evidence.
3. Provide feedback on orchestration surface decision to unblock D2 scaffolding.
