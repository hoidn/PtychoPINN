# Phase B.B2 Lightning Orchestration Evidence (2025-10-18T014317Z)

- Store `summary.md` once `_train_with_lightning` implementation is complete; include config mapping, dataloader strategy, and follow-up actions.
- Capture the green log for `pytest tests/torch/test_workflows_components.py::TestTrainWithLightningRed -vv` via `tee` as `pytest_train_green.log` in this directory.
- Drop any auxiliary diagnostics (e.g., trainer callbacks, config dumps) here with clear names, then reference each artifact from docs/fix_plan.md.
- Replace or delete this README when documenting the actual loop; it only guarantees the directory remains under version control before evidence lands.
