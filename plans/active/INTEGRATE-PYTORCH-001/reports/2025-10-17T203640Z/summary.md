# Phase F4 Planning Summary â€” 2025-10-17T203640Z

## Focus
- Initiative: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001
- Phase: F4 (Documentation, Spec Sync, Initiative Handoff)
- Objective: Provide detailed execution guidance so engineer loops can update authoritative docs/specs and notify downstream owners about the torch-required baseline.

## Key Decisions
1. Create dedicated plan file `phase_f4_doc_sync.md` with structured checklists for F4.1 (docs), F4.2 (specs/findings), F4.3 (handoffs).
2. Require artifact trio per F4 sub-phase: `doc_updates.md`, `spec_sync.md`, `handoff_notes.md` stored under new timestamped report directory.
3. Reference Phase F1 governance decision and Phase F3 regression logs as mandatory evidence when updating directives and findings.

## Next Steps for Engineer
- Execute F4.1 checklist first: inventory torch-optional language, update CLAUDE.md and workflow docs, document edits in `doc_updates.md`.
- Follow with F4.2 spec/finding updates once documentation drafts are prepared.
- Close with F4.3 handoff notes and ledger/plan synchronization.

## Artifacts
- Plan: `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/phase_f4_doc_sync.md`
- Reports: `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T203640Z/{summary.md}` (create additional files per checklist during execution loops).
