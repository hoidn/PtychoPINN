# 2025-10-19T205832Z — Phase E3 Planning Snapshot

## Objectives
- Scope the remaining Phase E3 tasks (documentation updates, spec sync, TEST-PYTORCH-001 handoff) now that Phase D parity work is complete.
- Provide structured guidance for Ralph to execute Phase E3 work in focused loops with clear artifact expectations.

## Key Artifacts
- `phase_e3_docs_plan.md` — Phased checklist covering gap assessment, documentation edits, spec alignment, and handoff deliverables.

## Next Steps
1. Execute Phase A inventory tasks before editing documentation.
2. Follow Phase B/C/D checklists in subsequent loops, storing artifacts under this timestamp.
3. Update `docs/fix_plan.md` with attempt notes referencing this plan when work begins.
