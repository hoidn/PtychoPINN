# Phase F Torch Mandatory Transition â€” Planning Summary

- Authored `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/phase_f_torch_mandatory.md` defining four phases (governance, inventory, implementation, documentation) to retire torch-optional code paths.
- Highlighted need to resolve conflict with existing CLAUDE.md directive that requires torch-optional parity; Phase F1 blocks implementation until governance updates guidance.
- Established artifact directory `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T184417Z/phase_f/` for future evidence, inventory, and migration notes.
- Next supervisor directive should steer Ralph toward Phase F1 checklist (catalogue conflicts, capture governance decision, update authoritative docs).
