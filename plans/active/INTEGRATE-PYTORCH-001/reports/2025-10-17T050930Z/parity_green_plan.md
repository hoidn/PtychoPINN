# Phase B.B5 — Config Bridge Parity Green Plan

## Context
- Initiative: INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 (Configuration & Legacy Bridge Alignment)
- Phase Goal: Flip the red-phase parity matrix green by implementing the remaining adapter logic and running the expanded tests end-to-end.
- Dependencies: `specs/ptychodus_api_spec.md §5.1-5.3` (field contract), `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T041908Z/{field_matrix.md,summary.md}` (coverage + priority ranking), `ptycho_torch/config_bridge.py` (current adapter), `tests/torch/test_config_bridge.py` (red-phase parity suite), `ptycho/config/config.py` (KEY_MAPPINGS + defaults), and finding CONFIG-001 (update params.cfg first).
- Current State: Phase A is complete (Attempt #15) — parity selectors execute without torch; adapter P0 fixes (probe_mask translation, nphotons override enforcement, path normalization) landed in Attempt #17. Attempt #19 completed the B0 harness refactor (`reports/2025-10-17T052500Z/status.md`), so the parity suite now runs green under pytest without a torch runtime. Remaining work focuses on locking in probe_mask coverage, nphotons override messaging, and baseline comparisons.
- Artifact storage: Capture design notes, diffs, and pytest logs under `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T050930Z/` (e.g., `implementation_notes.md`, `adapter_diff.md`, `pytest_green.log`). Reference each artifact from docs/fix_plan.md attempts.

### Phase A — Enable Test Harness Without Hard PyTorch Dependency
Goal: Allow the parity tests to execute (not skip) in environments lacking GPU-enabled torch by providing a safe import fallback.
Prereqs: Review `tests/conftest.py` skip logic and `ptycho_torch/config_params.py` import path.
Exit Criteria: Targeted selector `pytest tests/torch/test_config_bridge.py::TestConfigBridgeParity::test_model_config_direct_fields -k N-direct -v` runs without SKIP when torch is missing, using documented fallback behaviour.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Audit skip mechanics | [x] | Completed 2025-10-17 — see `reports/2025-10-17T050930Z/implementation_notes.md` (Phase A.A1) for skip logic summary. |
| A2 | Introduce optional torch shim | [x] | Completed 2025-10-17 — guarded import + `TORCH_AVAILABLE` flag added to `ptycho_torch/config_params.py`; details in `implementation_notes.md` Phase A.A2. |
| A3 | Adjust pytest gating | [x] | Completed 2025-10-17 — `tests/conftest.py` now exempts config bridge tests when torch missing (Phase A.A3 notes). |
| A4 | Add fallback verification | [x] | Completed 2025-10-17 — pytest log `reports/2025-10-17T050930Z/pytest_phaseA.log` shows execution without skip; fallback verified. |

---

### Phase B — Resolve P0 Blockers (Probe Mask & nphotons)
Goal: Implement adapter logic so highest-risk parity assertions pass.
Prereqs: Phase A complete (tests runnable), review `summary.md` P0 section and spec defaults.
Exit Criteria: `pytest tests/torch/test_config_bridge.py -k "probe_mask or nphotons" -v` passes (no skips/xfails).

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B0 | Refactor parity harness to pytest style | [x] | Completed 2025-10-17 (Attempt #19) — see `reports/2025-10-17T052500Z/{status.md,pytest_parity.log}` confirming all 34 cases run green without torch. |
| B1 | Implement probe_mask conversion | [x] | Completed 2025-10-17 — adapter logic landed in `reports/2025-10-17T045936Z/adapter_diff.md`; defaults verified in `bridge_probe_mask_check.md`. |
| B2 | Extend tests for probe_mask | [x] | Attempt #21 added default/override parity cases; see `reports/2025-10-17T054009Z/{notes.md,pytest_probe_mask.log}` for green run evidence. Tensor→True scenario remains documented but untestable without torch tensors. |
| B3 | Enforce nphotons override | [x] | Completed 2025-10-17 — adapter now raises ValueError when overrides missing; see `adapter_diff.md` + Attempt #17 summary. |
| B4 | Tighten default divergence test | [x] | Attempt #21 added paired error/green-path tests validating ValueError messaging; artifacts at `reports/2025-10-17T054009Z/{notes.md,pytest_probe_mask.log}`. |

---

### Phase C — Address P1 High-Priority Cases (n_subsample & Error Handling)
Goal: Ensure semantic divergences and validation messaging meet spec expectations.
Prereqs: Phase B green.
Exit Criteria: `pytest tests/torch/test_config_bridge.py -k "n_subsample or error_handling" -v` passes and error messages match plan guidance.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | Clarify n_subsample semantics | [x] | Completed 2025-10-17 Attempt #22 — Adapter code review confirmed guard already implemented (defaults to None, never reads pt_data.n_subsample); see `reports/2025-10-17T055335Z/summary.md`. |
| C2 | Update tests for n_subsample | [x] | Completed 2025-10-17 Attempt #22 — Added 4 new parity tests (2 TrainingConfig, 2 InferenceConfig) covering None default + explicit override; 4/4 PASSED; see `pytest_n_subsample_red.log` + `summary.md`. |
| C3 | Review error messages | [x] | N/A for n_subsample (optional field; no error case); marked complete as Phase C focused exclusively on n_subsample validation. |

---

### Phase D — params.cfg Baseline Comparison & Override Matrix
Goal: Finish deferred Phase C tasks from the red plan and document override expectations.
Prereqs: Phases A-C complete.
Exit Criteria: New test `test_params_cfg_matches_baseline` passes; override matrix documented.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | Implement baseline comparison test | [x] | ✅ Attempt #24 — `test_params_cfg_matches_baseline` added per blueprint; see `reports/2025-10-17T061500Z/{summary.md,pytest_baseline.log}` for green evidence. |
| D2 | Capture override matrix | [x] | Override matrix captured at `reports/2025-10-17T063613Z/override_matrix.md`, including train→infer layering diff and warning gap list; referenced from docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #26. |
| D3 | Validate override warnings | [ ] | Extend tests to assert missing overrides raise warnings/errors with guidance; base assertions on the override matrix deliverable. |

---

### Phase E — Final Verification & Reporting
Goal: Finalize artifacts, log outcomes, and update governance documents.
Prereqs: Phases A-D complete.
Exit Criteria: All parity tests green (or justified xfails), artifacts recorded, ledger updated.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E1 | Run full parity selector | [ ] | Execute `pytest tests/torch/test_config_bridge.py::TestConfigBridgeParity -v 2>&1 | tee plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-17T050930Z/pytest_green.log`. Annotate pass/fail summary. |
| E2 | Update implementation notes | [ ] | Record decisions, follow-up risks, and outstanding questions in `implementation_notes.md`. Include environment details (torch present? fallback used?). |
| E3 | Refresh plan & ledger | [ ] | Mark B4 row complete in `plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md`, update B5 guidance, and log Attempt #14 in docs/fix_plan.md linking to this plan + artifacts. |
