- Authored Phase B.B1 test design for `_train_with_lightning` TDD.
- Key deliverables:
  - `phase_b_test_design.md` enumerating three red tests and pytest selector guidance.
  - Plan checklist `B1` updated to reference the design and logging discipline.
- No code changes performed; focus remains on preparing next loop for TDD (Mode=TDD).
- Next engineer loop should:
  1. Implement the outlined tests under `tests/torch/test_workflows_components.py` (`TestTrainWithLightningRed`).
  2. Capture the failing run via `pytest ... -vv \\| tee plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-10-18T000606Z/phase_d2_completion/pytest_train_red.log`.
  3. Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempts with the red evidence and leave plan checklist `B1` marked `[P]`.
