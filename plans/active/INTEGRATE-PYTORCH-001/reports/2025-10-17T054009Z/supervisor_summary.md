# Supervisor Summary — Phase B.B5 Follow-Through

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-17T054009Z  
**Focus:** INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001 Phase B.B5 parity follow-through  
**Mode:** Parity  
**Action Type:** Review / housekeeping

## Key Updates
- Marked harness refactor complete in implementation plan (`plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/implementation.md`) and refreshed guidance to point at Attempt #19 evidence (`reports/2025-10-17T052500Z/status.md`).
- Updated parity green plan (`reports/2025-10-17T050930Z/parity_green_plan.md`) to reflect B0 completion and clarified remaining B2/B4 deliverables (probe_mask parity coverage, nphotons override messaging).
- Established this timestamped report directory to track follow-on artifacts for probe_mask tests and nphotons error messaging during Phase B.B5 execution.

## Next Actions for Engineer
1. Author probe_mask parity tests per parity green plan Phase B2 (default vs explicit tensor override) and capture pytest output under this directory.
2. Add failing→passing regression asserting the nphotons override ValueError contains actionable guidance, then re-run targeted selector.
3. Update docs/fix_plan.md attempts with resulting artifact paths and note whether additional optional B4/B2 scope remains.
