### Turn Summary
Verified the Phase R quick wins (config bridge invocation, persistence shim, and parity pytest) via the hub inventory + GREEN log and documented the completion inside the plan.
Rewrote docs/fix_plan.md and the plan/input brief so Ralph now targets wiring `scripts/training/train.py` / `scripts/inference/inference.py` through the backend selector while guarding TensorFlow-only persistence paths.
Next: implement the CLI routing plus new backend-dispatch tests, run the targeted pytest node, and refresh the hub artifact inventory + summaries.

### Turn Summary
Reactivated the PyTorch parity initiative with a Phase R checklist (config bridge wiring, spec default backfill, persistence shim, regression guard) and recorded the new reports hub so evidence lands under a single path.
Resteered docs/fix_plan.md, plans/ptychodus_pytorch_integration_plan.md, input.md, and galph_memory.md so Ralph’s next loop targets update_legacy_dict wiring plus the config-bridge pytest gate while logging to the new hub.
Next: Ralph implements the Phase R Do Now (bridge wiring + persistence shim + pytest selector) and records artifacts under plans/active/INTEGRATE-PYTORCH-001/reports/2025-11-13T150000Z/parity_reactivation/.
