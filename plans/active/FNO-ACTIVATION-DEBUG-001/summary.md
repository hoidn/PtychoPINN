### Turn Summary
Added one-off FNO activation debug script with hook-based stats capture and a JSON report output, plus a pytest smoke test.
Confirmed the new test fails without the script and passes after implementation, and archived pytest and ruff logs.
Left the manual activation report run pending because it needs a real train.npz path.
Artifacts: plans/active/FNO-ACTIVATION-DEBUG-001/reports/2026-01-27T081542Z/ (pytest_red.log, pytest_green.log, pytest_collect.log, ruff.log)
