# Dense Grouping Example
# Use case: Maximum data utilization with neighbor grouping
# This example shows how to use most of your subsampled data for training

# Scenario: You have a dataset with 10,000 images, but can only load 2,000 into memory
# You want to create as many training groups as possible from these 2,000 images

# For gridsize=2 (4 images per group):

echo "Key Points:"
echo "1. n_subsample controls how many images are loaded from disk"
echo "2. n_images controls how many groups are created"
echo "3. For dense grouping: n_images = n_subsample / (gridsizeÂ²)"
echo "4. This maximizes data utilization within memory constraints"
