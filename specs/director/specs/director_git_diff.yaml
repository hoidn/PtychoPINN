  Note that <goal> describes the intended purpose of the changes, and <diff> is the actual diff.
  Our purpose is twofold. first, to identify any regressions or bugs introduced by the changes, and second, to complete the <goal> and recover from failing tests.
  Analyze the diff and codebase with the above in mind. Then, explain how to fix any issues that you discover.

  # Summary of Changes: Adding Multi-Probe Support
  ## High-Level Changes
  The changes primarily focus on adding support for multiple probes in the../../ptychographic reconstruction pipeline. This involves significant modifications to handle probe indexing, selection, and management across multiple data containers.
  
  ## Key Components Modified
  
  ### MultiPtychoDataContainer
  - Added new container class for handling multiple probes
  - Supports probe indices and multiple probe management
  - Includes methods for merging multiple single-probe containers
  - Provides validation for probe indices and shapes
  - Adds handling for YY_full data availability
  
  ### ProbeIllumination Layer
  - Modified to support multiple probes
  - Added probe index input handling
  - Implements probe selection based on indices
  - Includes shape validation and error checking
  - Maintains support for Gaussian smoothing
  - Preserves probe masking functionality
  
  ### Model Architecture
  - Added input_probe_indices to model inputs
  - Updated model compilation to handle probe indices
  - Modified prepare_model_inputs to handle probe selection
  - Enhanced data preparation pipeline for multi-probe support
  
  ### Utility Functions
  - Added get_default_probe_indices for fallback behavior
  - Implemented probe validation functions
  - Added create_single_probe_fallback for compatibility
  - Enhanced probe shape handling
  
  ### Data Loading and Processing
  - Updated data container creation
  - Enhanced probe initialization
  - Modified training data preparation
  - Added support for probe indices in data generation
  
  ## Impact Areas
  1. Data Management:
     - Enhanced data containers to support multiple probes
     - Added probe indexing and validation
     - Modified data preparation pipeline
  
  2. Model Architecture:
     - Added probe index inputs
     - Updated model layers for probe selection
     - Enhanced probe illumination handling
  
  3. Training Pipeline:
     - Modified data preparation
     - Updated training procedures
     - Enhanced probe management during training
  
  4. Utilities and Support:
     - Added probe validation
     - Enhanced shape checking
     - Improved error handling
