for each subdir with .md file(s), split the docs into 1 or more .md files within the same subdir: (1) zero or one file, named CLAUDE.MD, containing ALL information useful to an agent working in a  
subdir; and (2) zero or more other .md files (generally a subset of the original files, with any sections that moved to CLAUDE.MD removed. Not that the new CLAUDE.md, if created, should contain          
sufficient references to the (2)nd set of .mds
the plan should specify that the max allowed CLAUDE.MD size is 500 lines
the plan is to specify that readmes should be left intact (this is an exception to the no-duplication rule)
