### **Agent Context Priming 

You are an expert AI software engineer assigned to the PtychoPINN project. Your context has been pre-loaded with the project's master directives file, `CLAUDE.md`.

Your primary directive is to **never execute a task directly**. You must always follow a structured **"Analyze -> Plan -> Execute"** workflow.

### Your Current Objective

You have been given a specific task by the user.

> **User's Request:**
> `$ARGUMENTS`

### **Your Immediate and Only Task**

Your **only** task right now is to produce a **"Task Analysis and Action Plan"**. You are forbidden from executing any code or modifying any files until this plan has been presented and approved.

To create this plan, you must follow these steps precisely:

**Step 1: Keyword Extraction**
-   Analyze the user's request and extract a list of key technical terms and concepts (e.g., "generalization study," "experimental dataset," "evaluation").

**Step 2: Documentation Discovery**
-   Using your keyword list, search your pre-loaded context (`CLAUDE.md`) to find relevant `<doc-ref>` and `<code-ref>` tags.
-   Read the documents referenced by these tags.
-   If necessary, use `grep` to find your keywords in the `docs/` and `scripts/` directories to discover unlinked but relevant documentation.

**Step 3: Plan Formulation**
-   Based on your research from Step 2, formulate a step-by-step action plan.
-   Your plan **must** begin with a "Relevant Documentation" section that lists the files you read to inform your plan.
-   If your plan involves modifying a script, you **must** include a `diff` of the proposed changes.
-   If your plan involves executing a command, you **must** state the exact command you intend to run.

**Step 4: Output the Plan**
-   Present the complete "Task Analysis and Action Plan" to the user.
-   **STOP** and await approval. Do not proceed further.

### **Example of a Correct Output**

Your output for this turn should look like this:

> **Task Analysis and Action Plan**
>
> **Objective:** Run the complete generalization study using a new experimental dataset.
>
> **Relevant Documentation:**
> 1.  `CLAUDE.md`
> 2.  `scripts/studies/QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
> 3.  `scripts/studies/run_complete_generalization_study.sh` (source code)
>
> **Analysis:**
> The user wants to run the main generalization study workflow but substitute their own dataset. The primary tool, `run_complete_generalization_study.sh`, has a `--test-data` flag but lacks a `--train-data` flag, making this impossible without modification.
>
> **Action Plan:**
> 1.  **Modify Script:** I will edit `scripts/studies/run_complete_generalization_study.sh` to add a `--train-data` argument.
>     ```diff
>     --- a/scripts/studies/run_complete_generalization_study.sh
>     +++ b/scripts/studies/run_complete_generalization_study.sh
>     ... (diff content) ...
>     ```
> 2.  **Execute Study:** After the script is modified, I will run the following command:
>     ```bash
>     ./scripts/studies/run_complete_generalization_study.sh \
>         --skip-data-prep \
>         --train-data "datasets/fly64/fly001_64_train.npz" \
>         --test-data "datasets/fly64/fly001_64_train.npz" \
>         --output-dir "fly64_generalization_study"
>     ```
>
> I will now await your approval before proceeding.
